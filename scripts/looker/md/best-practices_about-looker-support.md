_Is it possible to achieve this use case in Looker?_ |  "Cool! What are you working on, I'd be happy to point you in the right direction."   
_I'm getting this error and I'm not sure why._ |  "Let's put our heads together and troubleshoot to get you unstuck!"   
_Is this a bug?_ |  "Ouch. Let's make sure, if it is I'll work with engineering to report the unexpected behavior, and let you know next steps or timeline."   
_Help! I'm hitting a_ _critical issue._ |  "Can't access Looker or seeing performance problems? We can help investigate and get to a root cause!"   
_I prefer calls, can we handle this on a video call instead of chat/email?_ |  "Our support teams should be able to offer you a screen share if you prefer. We have found that screen shares are most useful when we're gathering information and trying to understand an issue. Screen shares must be scheduled ahead of time and are subject to availability."   
You can contact us by opening a case in the Google Cloud console or by using in-app support. For some types of questions, consider using the following resources:
