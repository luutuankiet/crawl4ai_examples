Looker gives you access to your organization's data. Many users start by browsing through saved query results — which we call _Looks_ — and dashboards that others in their organization have already created. This page will show you how to find that content and how to organize it to suit your needs. 
## Finding and viewing content
The following pages will help you start finding and viewing saved content:
  * Finding content in Looker — Find content others have created, such as Looks and dashboards.
  * Viewing dashboards — View and interact with dashboards.
  * Viewing Looks — View and interact with saved queries (which we call _Looks_).


## Organizing content
Once you have the basics down, you may be interested in organizing existing content:
  * Organizing with folders — Learn how to move, copy, and delete items within folders.
  * Presenting content with boards — Create boards that show curated sets of Looks and dashboards for your different teams.
  * Deleted and unused content for admins — Learn how you, as an admin, can further clean up deleted and unused content.
