  * Using Looker's embed solution


Looker's embed solution offers application developers and product teams an extremely fast time-to-value solution for delivering embedded analytics experience, ranging from single visualizations to complete dashboard or data exploration experiences.
Contrasted with solutions that are built entirely from the REST API, or solutions that are built using visualization components, the Looker embed solution offers a more out-of-the-box solution with all the functionality and UI built in to a single iframe.
## Using Looker's embed solution
You can integrate our embed solution into your web application either generating an embed URL from a Looker dashboard, Look, or Explore, or by manually including an iframe with an appropriately signed URL, or by leveraging our Embed SDK to facilitate the process. In addition, Looker customers who are looking to provide convenient access to already authenticated Looker users from the context of other applications can use our Private Embed modality to simplify the integration work even further.
## Try it out
