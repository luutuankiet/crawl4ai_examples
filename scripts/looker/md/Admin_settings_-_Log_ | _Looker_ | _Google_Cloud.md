## Log panel
The **Log** panel shows the 500 most recent system log messages that were generated by your Looker instance. To view the **Log** page, from the **Server** section of the **Admin** menu, select **Log**.
You can limit the information that is shown in the Log panel. To do so, enter text in the **Filter** field to have the Log panel show only messages that include that text.
To update the log and show the most recent 500 messages, select **Refresh Log**.
To adjust the severity level of log messages that are shown for Looker services, adjust the log levels.
## Log levels
The **Log Levels** section lets you set the minimum severity level required for a message to show up in the log, for several different Looker services. This lets you hide log information that does not interest you.
> The default severity level for the **db:** * and **db:looker** services is set to **info** , which means SQL statements that contain or filter on personal information (for example, customer names) are logged by Looker. This is true for severity settings of **info** , **verbose** , or **debug**. To turn off logging of SQL statements, set the severity level of the **db:** * and **db:looker** services to **warn** , **error** , or **fatal**.
### Severity descriptions
Log message severity levels are listed next, from least severe to most severe:
  * **debug** : Debug log entries are detailed information messages that show Looker's internal application processes. This severity level is typically used only for debugging internal code.
  * **verbose** : These are detailed informational messages that show events occurring in Looker at a more finely grained level. This severity level is typically used only for troubleshooting.
  * **info** : These are standard informational messages that show regular events occurring in Looker.
  * **warn** : These messages indicate potentially harmful situations.
  * **error** : These messages indicate error events that are probably not serious enough to cause Looker to stop running.
  * **fatal** : These messages indicate very severe error events that will likely cause Looker to stop running.


### Service descriptions
The **Default** drop-down sets the default severity level for all Looker services. All services that are set to **default** use the severity level in the **Default** drop-down. The default severity level for the **Default** drop-down is **info**.
You can also set severity levels individually for the following services:
  * **pdt** : Messages that are associated with the persistent derived table process.
  * **db:** *: Messages that are generated by queries to the analytics database or by queries to any customer database.
  * **db:looker** : Messages that are generated by queries to the Looker backend database.
  * **http** : Messages that are generated from HTTP requests that the frontend webserver is receiving or processing.
  * **http_core** : Messages that are generated from HTTP requests to the core webserver that serves the internals of the application.
  * **jsch** : Messages that are generated by SSH connections to the Git service. The default setting is **warn** level, which displays no information. Change to the **info** level to troubleshoot SSH connection issues.
  * **logger** : Messages that are generated when you make changes to the log level.
  * **org.apache.active** : Messages that are generated by ActiveMQ. ActiveMQ is a messaging service that Looker uses to communicate tasks between subsystems. It is used by the scheduler, PDT regeneration, and other long-running tasks.
  * **raven** : Messages that are generated by the error reporting service.
  * **render** : Messages that are generated by the renderer, which renders PDFs and PNGs.
  * **scheduler** : Messages that are generated by the scheduler process.


After you have modified the log level for a service, select **Set Levels** to save your changes.
## Setting the log format on customer-hosted instances
By default, system messages are displayed in text using the following format:
```
2019-09-25 15:14:12.301 -0700 [INFO|007d0|main] :: Starting Looker : Version 6.21.0-localdev-ea88a4
...
2019-10-01 14:37:53.424 -0700 [INFO|0002a|http] :: Request from 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1  GET /folders/1, {}
...
2019-10-01 14:37:53.425 -0700 [INFO|0002a|db:looker] :: (0.000180s) SELECT count(*) AS "COUNT" FROM "USER" LIMIT 1

```

Some system messages, such as exceptions and SQL queries, are generated as multiple-line output. This can cause problems for log processors that require single-line entries for pattern matching.
If your Looker instance is customer-hosted and you require single-line output, you can use the `--log-format=json` startup option to format log entries into single-line JSON structures. The following example shows the same events as the previous example, but in JSON format:
```
{"t":"2019-09-25 15:14:56.513 -0700","s":"INFO","rid":"007d0","c":"main","msg":"Starting Looker : Version 6.21.0-localdev-ea88a4"}
...
{"t":"2019-10-01T14:35:37.577 -07:00","s":"INFO","rid":"0002c","c":"http","ip":"0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1","verb":"GET","path":"/folders/1","params":{}}
...
{"t":"2019-10-01T14:35:37.581 -07:00","s":"INFO","rid":"0002c","c":"db:looker","duration":"0.000344","sql":"SELECT count(*) AS \"COUNT\" FROM \"USER\" LIMIT 1"}

```
