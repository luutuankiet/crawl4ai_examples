After you've created an embed — which can be done publicly, privately, with signed embedding, or through the API — you can interact with those iframes using JavaScript. You can make your page more dynamic based on the status of the embedded item, and you can even make changes to the embedded item from your web page.
Be aware that Looker doesn't control the order in which browsers dispatch events to web applications. This means that the order of events is not guaranteed across browsers or platforms. Be sure to write your JavaScript appropriately to account for the event handling of different browsers.
You can use JavaScript in one of the following ways for Looker embedded content:
  * Using Looker's embed Software Development Kit (SDK), described on the Embed SDK documentation page
  * Using JavaScript events, described in the Accessing events in JavaScript section on this page


## Preparation
Before you can interact with the embedded iframe, follow these steps:
  * Add an ID to the iframe.
  * Add the embed domain to the iframe `src` attribute.
  * Add the embed domain to the allowlist.


### Adding an ID to the iframe
Later, when you retrieve data from the iframe, you'll need to validate that the information you're working with has actually come from Looker's iframe. To facilitate this, be sure to add an ID to your iframe, if you haven't done so already. In the following example, you set the ID to `looker` by adding `id="looker"` to the iframe:
```
<iframeid="looker"src="https://instance_name.looker.com/embed/dashboards/1"></iframe>

```

### Adding the embed domain to the iframe `src` attribute
In the iframe's `src` attribute, include the domain where the iframe is being used. In the following example, you can specify `myownpersonaldomain.com` as the domain by adding `?embed_domain=https://myownpersonaldomain.com"` to the end of the URL in the `src` attribute:
```
<iframe
id="looker"
src="https://instance_name.looker.com/embed/dashboards/1?embed_domain=https://myownpersonaldomain.com">
</iframe>

```

If you're using signed embedding, make sure you add the `embed_domain` to the embed URL.
If you're using the Embed SDK, add `sdk=3` to the end of the embed URL. The `sdk=3` parameter indicates that the SDK is present and that Looker can take advantage of additional features that the SDK provides, such as passing JavaScript events between the Looker iframe and your domain. The SDK can't add this parameter itself because it is part of the signed URL. For example:
```
<iframe
id="looker"
src="https://instance_name.looker.com/embed/dashboards/1?embed_domain=https://myownpersonaldomain.com&sdk=2">
</iframe>

```

### Adding the embed domain to the allowlist
Finally, you'll need to add the domain where the iframe is being used to the allowlist on the **Embed** page of Looker's **Admin** panel by following these steps:
  1. In the **Embedded Domain Allowlist** field, enter the domain where the iframe is being used, and then press the Tab key so that the domain appears in a box within the field.
  2. Click **Update**.


You can use the `*` wildcard in the allowlist to create a domain pattern. For example, `https://*.myownpersonaldomain.com` would allow both `https://analytics.myownpersonaldomain.com` and `https://data.myownpersonaldomain.com`.
If you're using cookieless embedding with Looker 23.8 or later, the embed domain can be specified when the cookieless session is acquired. This is an alternative to adding the embed domain to the allowlist using the **Admin > Embed** panel. Review the security best practices if you decide to take advantage of this feature.
## Retrieving data from the iframe
After completing the preparation steps, you can access the events that are passed between the Looker iframe and your domain by listening for `postMessage` events.
The embedded iframe can create a few event types, as described in the Event type reference section on this page.
### Accessing events in JavaScript
Here is an example of listening for these events in JavaScript, and then logging the events to the console:
```
window.addEventListener("message",function(event){
if(event.source===document.getElementById("looker").contentWindow){
if(event.origin==="https://instance_name.looker.com"){
console.log(JSON.parse(event.data));
}
}
});

```

Here is an example of listening for these events in jQuery, then logging them to the console:
```
$(window).on("message",function(event){
if(event.originalEvent.source===$("#looker")[0].contentWindow){
if(event.origin==="https://instance_name.looker.com"){
console.log(JSON.parse(event.data));
}
}
});

```

## Making changes to the iframe
After you've prepped your iframe for data retrieval, you can make changes to the iframe with the following steps:
  1. Write your request in JSON.
  2. Post the request to the iframe's `contentWindow`.


### Writing your request in JSON
You can make several changes to the iframe, which you'll submit in JSON form. The available options are described in the Action reference section on this page. Don't forget to use `JSON.stringify` to turn your action into JSON, like this:
```
varmy_request=JSON.stringify(
{
type:"dashboard:run"
}
);

```

### Posting the request to the iframe's `contentWindow` property
Finally, post your message to the iframe's `contentWindow`, like this:
```
varmy_iframe=document.getElementById("my_iframe_id");

my_iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(my_request,'https://instance_name.looker.com');

```

### Action summary table
The following table summarizes actions. Select an action to see the details about that action.
Action | Action Description  
---|---  
Loads a new page in the iframe, replacing the existing page.  
Loads a new dashboard in the iframe, replacing an existing dashboard.  
Runs the dashboard in the iframe.  
Added 22.20  Switches the dashboard into edit mode.  
`dashboard:filters:update` | Updates an existing dashboard filter in the iframe.  
`dashboard:options:set` | Writes new values to dashboard layout and dashboard element properties.  
`dashboard:schedule_modal:open` | Opens the Scheduler, which lets users deliver Looker content to various destinations.  
Stops a dashboard that is running or reloading data.  
Runs the Look in the iframe.  
`look:filters:update` | Updates an existing Look filter in the iframe.  
Runs the Explore in the iframe.  
`explore:filters:update` | Updates or removes an existing Explore filter in the iframe.  
`session:tokens:request` | Sends tokens in response to a `session:tokens:request` event.  
Sends information about the current scroll position of the host iframe to the embedded Looker application.  
### Action reference
These are the available actions you can post to the embedded iframe:
#### `page:load`
Use this action to navigate to new content within the iframe, replacing the existing content. This action is similar to the `dashboard:load` action but is more flexible, as additional parameters can be specified in the URL.
There are differences in behavior that should be considered before using `page:load`. `dashboard:load` will prevent the navigation from happening if the current dashboard is being edited. `page:load` doesn't prevent the navigation from happening. The host application may determine if a dashboard or Look is being edited by tracking `dashboard:edit:start`, `look:edit:start`, and their corresponding edit end events. For this reason, we recommend using the embed SDK. The embed SDK tracks whether a dashboard or Look is being edited, and so the connection can be queried to see if content is being edited prior to navigation.
```
{
type:'page:load',
url:'/embed/dashboard/32?state=california,
pushHistory:false
}

```

Attribute | Format | Description  
---|---|---  
`type` | String | Using the type `page:load` indicates that you want to load new content into the iframe.  
`url` | String | The URL of the content to load.  
`pushHistory` | Boolean | If `true`, the content loaded creates a new browser history entry, and the user can use the browser's back button to return to the previous content. If `false`, the current content is replaced and browser navigation can't be used to return to it.  
#### `dashboard:load`
Use this action to load a new dashboard in the iframe, replacing an existing dashboard. The new dashboard will begin executing queries as if a new dashboard page had been opened.
```
{
type:"dashboard:load",
id:"101",
pushHistory:false
}

```

Attribute | Format | Description  
---|---|---  
`type` | String | Using the type `dashboard:load` indicates that you want to load a new dashboard into the iframe.  
String | The ID of the dashboard to load.  
`pushHistory` | Boolean | If `true`, the dashboard that is loaded creates a new browser history entry, and the user can use the browser's back button to return to the previous dashboard. If `false`, the current dashboard is replaced and browser navigation can't be used to return to it.  
#### `dashboard:run`

#### `dashboard:options:set`
This action is available after the `dashboard:run:complete` event occurs.
The embedder creates the message and sends it to the iframe, but the dashboard does not respond until after `dashboard:run:complete` occurs. The `dashboard:options:set` action writes new values to dashboard layout and dashboard element properties. Only properties that have been returned in the `options` attribute of the `dashboard:run:complete` event can be updated using `dashboard:options:set`. Any properties set that were not previously returned by the `options` attribute of the `dashboard:run:complete` event are ignored.
