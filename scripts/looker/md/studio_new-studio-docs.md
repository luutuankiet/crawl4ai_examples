  * A note about language support


In January 2024, Looker Studio documentation moved from support.google.com to Google Cloud. This new site better supports our mission to evolve and unify our business intelligence products. With this move you have more convenient access to related product documentation, such as Looker, BigQuery, Gemini, and more. In addition, Looker Studio documentation lives on the same platform that hosts all of Google Cloud's administrator and developer tools.
## A note about language support
The Google Cloud platform supports a different set of languages and locales than Help Center. Looker Studio documentation is available in the following languages:
  * English
  * German
  * French
  * Indonesian
  * Italian
  * Korean
  * Japanese
  * Portuguese
  * Latin American Spanish (New)
  * Traditional Chinese (New)


Google no longer provides Looker Studio documentation in Dutch or Hindi.
