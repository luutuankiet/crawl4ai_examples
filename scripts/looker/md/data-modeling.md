To unlock the magic of Looker, data experts at each organization describe their data in a lightweight modeling language called _LookML_. LookML tells Looker how to query data so everyone in the organization can create Looks and dashboards without needing to understand the behind-the-scenes details. This page outlines the documentation on preparing to write LookML.
