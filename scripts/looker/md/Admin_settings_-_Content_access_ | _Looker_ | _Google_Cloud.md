Content access levels control which users may edit folder contents (such as Looks and dashboards), view the contents in a folder, and change folder settings. Access levels can be adjusted for each folder, as described on the Organizing and managing access to content and the Designing and configuring a system of access levels documentation pages. While folders can be adjusted from the **Folders** section of the Looker main menu, admins may find it easier to make changes from the **Content Access** page in the **Users** section of the **Admin** menu.
## Finding a folder to edit
Your hierarchy of folders shows in the **Folders** section. Click the folder that you want to edit, or expand a folder by clicking the arrow to its left.
## Adjusting access options
To adjust who can view or edit the folder, click the **Manage Access** button underneath the **Folders** section. These options are described in greater detail on the Organizing and managing access to content documentation page.
## Interaction of content access and permissions
Some permissions affect the visibility and accessibility of Looks and dashboards in folders. See the Access control and permission management documentation page for details.
