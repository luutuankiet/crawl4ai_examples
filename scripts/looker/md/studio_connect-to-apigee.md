Apigee is a platform for developing and managing APIs. The Looker Studio Apigee connector lets you create reports and dashboards based on analytics and monetization data and share them with stakeholders and customers.
## How to connect to Apigee
A Looker Studio data source can connect to a single Apigee organization.
### Select an individual account
  1. Sign in to Looker Studio.
  2. On the Looker Studio home page, in the top left, click **Create** , and then select **Data Source**.
  3. Select the **Apigee** connector.
  4. If prompted to grant Looker Studio access to your account, click **AUTHORIZE**.

## Configure the data source
The data source fields panel is where you configure the data source by renaming fields and adding descriptions, adding calculated fields, and changing data types and aggregations. Learn more about working with data source fields.
## Control who sees the data
At the top of the fields panel, you can change the data credentials. Credentials control who can see the data that this data source provides.
**OWNER'S CREDENTIALS** let other people view or create reports that use this data without requiring them to have their own access to the dataset.
**VIEWER'S CREDENTIALS** , on the other hand, require each user of the data source to provide their own credentials to access the dataset.
**SERVICE ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS** rely on a special type of Google Account that represents a non-human user that can authenticate and be authorized to access data.
Learn more about data credentials.
## Create a new report from the data source
To create a new report from the data source, follow these steps:
  1. In the upper right, click **CREATE REPORT**. The report editor appears.
  2. Click **ADD TO REPORT**. 
    1. This action adds the data source to the report.
    2. You can now create charts and controls that get their data from this data source.
