> This article is intended to help you understand the differences between Looker Studio Pro content and content that is created in the no-cost version of Looker Studio.
Content — reports and data sources — that you create using the no-cost version of Looker Studio is _Looker Studio content_. Content that you create in or move to a Looker Studio Pro project is _Looker Studio Pro content_. The main differences between Looker Studio content and Looker Studio Pro content appear in the following areas:
  * Access to Pro features
  * Content ownership
  * Content location and management


## Access to Pro features
Looker Studio content can use only the features that are available in the no-cost version of the product. Looker Studio content can't use Looker Studio Pro features.
Looker Studio Pro content can include Pro features, such as managing content with team workspaces, multiple delivery schedules, and personal report links. Looker Studio Pro users can also access technical support.
**Note** : Access to technical support requires both a Google Cloud support plan and a Looker Studio Pro subscription.
## Content ownership
Looker Studio content is owned by the person who created that content. If you're using Looker Studio in an organization, and the owner of some Looker Studio content leaves the org, you may lose access to the content unless the original owner transfers that content to a new, active owner in your organization.
Looker Studio Pro content, on the other hand, is owned by your organization. That content will continue to work even if the creator of that content leaves the organization.
## Content location and management
Looker Studio content lives in a Google Cloud project that Google administers for you. Looker Studio content that you own appears in the **Owned by me** location in the left navigation panel of the Looker Studio user interface. Content that is owned by other people and shared with you appears under **Shared with me**.
Looker Studio Pro content lives in a Google Cloud project that is managed by your organization. Administrators can manage Looker Studio Pro using the Google Cloud console and Google Workspace Admin console. Looker Studio Pro content that you create appears either in a team workspace or in a **Sandbox** under that project.
If your administrator has set up a default Pro project, and you have a Pro license on that project, you won't see **Owned by me** in your left navigation. You can create content only in your **Sandbox** or in a team workspace.
