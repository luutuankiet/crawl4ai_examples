Once a data modeler understands the basic concepts of creating projects and developing in Looker, it's time to write LookML! The power of LookML gives developers lots of flexibility to work with their organization's data and create custom experiences for Looker users. This page outlines the documentation on LookML. 
## Getting started with LookML
  * Steps to learning LookML — View a plan for learning to use LookML.
  * Looker (Google Cloud core) quickstart overview — For Looker (Google Cloud core) instances, view the quickstarts that are available to help you get started with Looker, from connecting to your data warehouse to creating and sharing dashboards with rich visualizations.


## Basic concepts
The following pages help you understand the basics of LookML:
  * What is LookML? — Get a high-level overview of LookML.
  * LookML terms and concepts — Understand the terminology for major LookML structures.
  * Looker IDE overview — Use the LookML development environment and its features.
  * Validating LookML — Check for errors and validate your LookML.
  * Content validation — Validate, fix errors, and make bulk changes to Looks and dashboards.
  * Incorporating SQL and referring to LookML objects — Understand substitution, scoping, and SQL blocks in LookML.
  * Additional LookML basics — Apply field labels, filters, percentages, and sets in LookML.
  * Working with joins in LookML — Build joins to connect different views and see how your data relates.
  * Derived tables in Looker — Define, add persistence, reference, and troubleshoot derived tables.
  * Creating native derived tables — Define derived tables using an Explore and LookML instead of SQL.
  * Changing the Explore menu and field picker — Modify the Explore menu and field picker.
  * Changing filter suggestions — Customize filter suggestions with these LookML parameters.
  * Looker Blocks — Use pre-built pieces of LookML to accelerate LookML model development.


## Advanced concepts
The following pages help you learn more sophisticated LookML skills:
  * Caching queues and rebuilding PDTs with datagroups — Define how frequently to rebuild PDTs and refresh query caches.
  * Aggregate awareness — Use aggregate awareness to make database querying more efficient.
  * Reusing code with extends — Create and merge reusable chunks of LookML with the `extends` parameter.
  * LookML refinements — Adapt and build on existing elements with LookML refinements.
  * Importing files from other projects — Import files into your LookML project from other LookML projects.
  * Templated filters and Liquid parameters — Create dimensions and measures that dynamically change with user input.
  * Liquid variable reference — Use Liquid templating in LookML for more dynamic content.
  * HTML sanitization — View a list of the HTML tags, HTML tag attributes, and CSS properties that Looker allows.
  * Localizing your LookML model — Localize elements of your LookML model.
