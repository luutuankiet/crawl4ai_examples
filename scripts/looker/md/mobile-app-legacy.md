  * Differences between the Looker and Looker Mobile (Legacy) applications


The Looker Mobile (Legacy) application lets users view recently viewed and favorite Looks and dashboards, view the boards that they follow, browse content that is stored in folders, and share content on a mobile device.
## Deprecation
Starting on March 1, 2026, the Looker Mobile (Legacy) app will be discontinued. The app will be unavailable for download on the App Store or Play Store, and users won't be able to use the app to access any Looker instances.
Instead, mobile users should access Looker instances with the Looker application or by using a web browser.
Looker will continue to support the Looker Mobile (Legacy) app until March 1, 2026.
