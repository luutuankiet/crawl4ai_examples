### Copy an existing dashboard
Creates a copy of an existing dashboard, in a specified folder, and returns the copied dashboard.
`dashboard_id` is required, `dashboard_id` and `folder_id` must already exist if specified. `folder_id` will default to the existing folder.
If a dashboard with the same title already exists in the target folder, the copy will have '(copy)' or '(copy <# of copies>)' appended.
