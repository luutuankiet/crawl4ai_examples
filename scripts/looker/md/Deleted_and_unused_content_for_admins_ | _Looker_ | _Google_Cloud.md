Looker offers admins several folders for managing unused and unwanted content. The **Unused Content** and **Trash** folders are located under the **Folders** item in the main navigation panel.
You should periodically go through these folders to delete content that isn't needed.
## Unused content
The **Unused Content** folder lists dashboards and Looks that haven't been viewed within the past 90 days, or within a time range that was selected using the **Time since last use** drop-down menu. The list does not include public content, content that is scheduled for delivery or part of a user's favorites, or Looks that are embedded within a dashboard.
To delete dashboards or Looks, follow these steps:
  1. From the **Time since last use** drop-down menu, select the time range that you want to review for unused content.
  2. Select the dashboards and Looks that you want to delete: 
     * Select all dashboards or all Looks in either the **Dashboards** or **Looks** section of the list using the **Select All** checkbox and then the **Select all x Dashboards** or **Select all x Looks** option that appears.
     * Select individual dashboards or Looks by using the checkbox in the same row.
  3. Click the **Move to Trash** button to move the selected content to the trash.


Alternatively, you can click the **Move all to trash** button at the top of the page to remove **all** listed Looks and dashboards.
## Trash
The **Trash** folder shows you any dashboards or Looks that were deleted by users (these dashboards and Looks are also called "soft-deleted"). You can select any number of dashboards and Looks, and then choose what to do with them — permanently delete them or restore them. You can also sort the thumbnails by using the **Sort by** drop-down menu in the top right of each section.
To restore or permanently delete content, follow these steps:
  1. Select the dashboards and Looks that you want to restore or permanently delete: 
     * Select all dashboards or all Looks in the **Dashboards** or **Looks** section of the list using the **Select All** button and then the **Select all x Looks** or **All x dashboards** option that appears.
     * Select individual dashboards or Looks by using the checkbox in the same row.
  2. Click the **Restore** button to move the selected content back to folders. Or click the **Delete** button to _permanently_ delete the content. Deleting content here cannot be undone.


Alternatively, to delete **all** Looks and dashboards from the list, click the **Delete All** button at the top of the page.
If you restore a dashboard or a Look, it will return to the folder that it was deleted from, _if_ that folder still exists. Otherwise, the content will be saved to the folder of the admin who restores the content.
Content in the **Trash** folder does not expire and will remain until you restore or permanently delete it.
