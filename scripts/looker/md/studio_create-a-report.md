You can create Looker Studio reports in the following ways:
  * Create a new report
  * Create a report from a template
  * Create a report from a product integration


## Create a new report
  1. Sign in to Looker Studio.
  2. Click **Create** and then select **Report**.
  3. You'll see the report editor tool, with the **Add data to report** panel open. This panel has two tabs: **Connect to data** and **My data sources**.
> You'll learn more about connectors and data sources in the Connect to your data topic.
    1. In the **Connect to data** tab, select a connector, create a new data source, and add that to your report:
      1. Select the type of data that you want to visualize.
      2. Provide your account or other details.
      3. In the bottom right, click **Add**.
    2. Use **My data sources** to add an existing data source to your report:
      1. Locate the data source that you want.
      2. In the bottom right, click **Add**.
      3. The data source is added to your report.
  4. A table appears with fields from that data source.
Use the properties panel on the right to change the data and style of the table.
  5. By default, the layout type is set to **Freeform layout**. To use a responsive report instead, select the **Responsive layout** type. You can change the layout setting later.
     * A freeform report is tailored for desktop screens. Choose this report type if you want pixel-perfect control over the placement and sizing of each report component.
     * A responsive report scales well across many different screen sizes. Choose this report type if you expect your users to regularly view the report on a tablet or other mobile device.
  6. In the top left, name your report by clicking **Untitled Report** and then entering a new name.
  7. (Optional) Add a description to your report by clicking the three-dot menu and selecting **Details**. Then add a description to the **Description** field.


## Create a report from a template
Templates let you visualize your data in a finished report. Use these reports "as is" or customize them to fit your unique requirements. You can also create your own templates for others to use.
Visit the Template Gallery to access templates built by Google. You'll find templates that support the following products:
  * BigQuery
  * Google Analytics
  * Google Ads
  * Google Sheets
  * YouTube Analytics
  * Search Console
  * Display & Video 360
  * Search Ads 360
  * Apigee


Learn more about how templates work.
## Create a report from a product integration
Product developers can use the Looker Studio Linking API to integrate Looker Studio into their products. This lets users of those products quickly see their data without having to set up the Looker Studio report themselves.
You can see examples of Looker Studio integration in the following Google products:
