Google Cloud acquired Looker in 2020. Until now you have been reaching out to Looker Support for queries about Looker. Looker Support is now integrating with Google Cloud to deliver a streamlined service so that Google Cloud Customer Care can answer all your queries. This means customers who signed up for Looker and Google Cloud Standard or Enhanced Support can raise and manage technical issues for Looker and Google Cloud solutions consistently in a single powerful way without the inconvenience of switching between the systems. 
This development changes how support will be delivered. Looker Support will no longer be available when you want to renew your support subscription. Instead, you can opt for one of the services from the Customer Care portfolio. While Looker chat is still available to answer queries about Looker, you can use the Google Cloud console to track, manage, and escalate your cases. You also have access to all the additional features provided by the support service you choose. 
For more information on how these changes will affect you, view the FAQs section at the end of the page.

## Choosing a Customer Care service
Each service in the Customer Care portfolio is designed to meet you where you are in your Google Cloud journey. You can visit the Cloud Customer Care Services page to compare different services and find the one that best suits your business needs. 
## Getting started with Customer Care
Once you've selected a support service that meets your needs, you can sign up for that service. Visit the How to sign up for a support service documentation page for more information regarding the sign-up process. 
## Granting Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
After you sign up for a service, your Google Cloud organizational administrator must grant you Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions and add you to an IAM role to give you access to Support to view and manage support cases. 
Please note that your Google Cloud organizational administrator may not be the same as your Looker administrator. This step must be completed by your Google Cloud organizational administrator. 
Visit the Granting IAM roles section of the Access control with IAM documentation page for more information regarding implementing IAM roles and permissions. 
## Submitting support cases
Once you've been granted IAM permissions, you can create a case with Support if you need assistance resolving a technical issue with Looker or Google Cloud. 
Visit the Create a support case section of the Support procedures documentation page to learn how to create a support case. 
## Managing support cases
You can manage support cases from the **Case** page. Any user in your organization with permission to edit support cases can comment on the case, upload file attachments, or modify case attributes — even if they did not create the case. 
Visit the Manage existing support cases section of the Support procedures documentation page to learn how to manage existing support cases. 
## Escalating a case
If an issue has a significant business impact or requires attention beyond regular case support, the **Escalate** **case** button will escalate your case. Escalating your case will page a Customer Care manager to fast-track the resolution process to minimize any further impacts to your business. 
Visit the Escalate a case section of the Support procedures documentation page to learn how to escalate existing support cases. 
## FAQs
**Why is my support changing?**
In early 2020, Looker was acquired by Google. Since that time, you've been accustomed to accessing the Google Cloud support service for issues related to Google Cloud products, and reaching out to Looker support for queries about Looker. Looker and Google Cloud are now integrated to deliver a streamlined service. Accessing support for both Google and Looker products under a single platform delivers powerful benefits. You'll enjoy the same Looker service you know and love, enhanced and expanded in what it offers. 
**What does this mean for me?**
With the Looker customer support integration with Google Cloud Customer Care, Looker Support will also be available in the Google Cloud console. This means that Google Cloud Support will now serve as your single source for all queries pertaining to Looker. Instead of navigating multiple support workflows, you can raise and manage technical issues for both Looker and Google Cloud products consistently in a single, powerful experience without the inconvenience of switching between systems. Chat support will still be available on your Looker account. 
**When does this change go live?**
Starting August 1 you will be able to file Looker cases via Google Cloud console. The complete transition to Customer Care will be effective upon your next Looker renewal date. Until renewal, you will not incur any additional price increase to receive Looker support through the Google Cloud console. Upon renewal, Looker Support will become a part of your existing Google Cloud support service and you will be charged as per the applicable variable fee. 
**When will I stop receiving Looker support?**
You will continue receiving support for Looker, but your service will be integrated with Google Cloud and accessed through the Google Cloud console. This integrates Looker support with your existing Google Cloud Support service onto a single system. Your Looker support will be provided according to the Google Cloud Support service you opt for after your renewal date. 
**How will I submit support cases in the new system?**
Your Google Cloud organizational administrator must first grant you IAM permissions. Once you have IAM permissions, you can reach out to Support for help by completing the following steps: 
  1. Sign in to the Google Cloud console Support page as a support user. 
  2. Select the project that requires a new support case. 
  3. Open **Cases**. 
  4. Select **Create case**. 
  5. Complete the required fields and submit the form. 


Once you submit the form, you will be redirected to the **Case** page where you can manage new and existing cases, comment on cases, upload file attachments, or modify case attributes. 
**Can I still use the chat function to file a case?**
Yes. Support for Looker will continue to be offered via Chat, delivering the same convenient access that you're used to. Visit the Looker Support details Best Practices page to learn more about Looker chat support. 
**Why is the price increasing?**
The Google Cloud Customer Care portfolio offers you the ability to choose a support service based on your organization's budget and needs. This portfolio includes different levels of support, all with various features that deliver added value to help your business succeed. Whether you're looking for fast responses, self-managed support, or Value-Add Services, you can find a service that suits your business needs. This means you not only gain a more robust support experience, but you also get more control over choosing what's right for your business. This additional value is reflected in the price. 
**Will my Service-Level Objective (SLO) change?**
As Looker Support integrates into Google Cloud, you will be transitioning to one of the Customer Care support services. Each service has its own SLO, which means that your SLO might be different from what you're used to. The SLO change depends on the support package you previously had with Looker, and the Support Service Offer you are transitioning to with Google Cloud. You may have the same SLOs after transition, or you may experience an increase or decrease in SLOs. You can find Looker SLOs on the Looker Technical Support Services Guidelines page, and Google Cloud SLOs on the Google Cloud Platform Services: Technical Support Services Guidelines page. 
For example, if you currently have Core Looker Support, switching to Customer Care Enhanced Support will maintain your response time SLO, while switching to Standard Support will mean an SLO decrease from 1 hour to 4 hours for P1. You can upgrade your support service at any time to get an SLO that suits your organization's needs. 
**What additional features are included in Google Cloud Support?**
The Google Cloud Customer Care portfolio offers various levels of support, including Standard, Enhanced, and Premium Support. You can visit the Cloud Customer Care Services page to compare different services and find the one that best suits your business needs. 
The portfolio also offers an array of custom Value-Add Services to supercharge support in your business. These offerings include the Technical Account Advisor Service, Planned Event Support, Assured Support, and Mission Critical Services. To find out more, visit the Cloud Customer Care documentation page. 
**Where can I find directions for specific support procedures?**
Visit the Support procedures documentation page to find step-by-step instructions for various Customer Care procedures. 
**Can I escalate cases?**
Yes — If an issue has a significant business impact or requires attention beyond regular case support, you can choose to escalate your case. You can escalate a case through the Google Cloud console. 
**How do I get in touch with Google Cloud Support?**
Google Cloud Customer Care offers multi-channel access. This means that there are multiple ways to reach out to access the support and technical guidance you need. For most customers, the Google Cloud console offers the best option. Visit the Contact Customer Care section on the Support procedures documentation page.
