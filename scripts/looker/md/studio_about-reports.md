#  About reports
Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 
A Looker Studio asset that presents information and insights derived from your data.
Reports let you visualize your data, gain insights, and share those insights with others. You can share reports with other people and let them just view the data, or give them edit access so they can change the report structure. Reports can consist of multiple pages, charts and other components, such as controls, text areas, shapes, and images.
