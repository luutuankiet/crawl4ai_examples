# Build a Look with sample data
bookmark_borderbookmark Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Learn how to query and visualize data in Looker and to save your query results as a Look that you can share and reuse.
This quickstart guides you through building a Look on your Looker (Google Cloud core) instance. You'll use sample data from the prebuilt **Intermediate Ecommerce** Explore to create the following table chart, and then you'll save the chart as a Look.
The table chart that you'll create will display weekly shipping trends, using conditional formatting (such as a red background) to highlight potential delays (in this case, weeks where more than 200 order items took over two days to be delivered). The following table is an example of the query results that you'll use to build your Look:
Created At Week | 2024-07-29 | 2024-07-22 | 2024-07-15 | 2024-07-08 | 2024-07-01 | 2024-06-24 | 2024-06-17 | 2024-06-10  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Shipped to Delivered Days | # of Order Items | # of Order Items | # of Order Items | # of Order Items | # of Order Items | # of Order Items | # of Order Items | # of Order Items  
4 | 451 | 242 | 210 | 199 | 163 | 152 | 189 | 177  
3 | 422 | 260 | 213 | 177 | 213 | 144 | 171 | 165  
## Before you begin
To follow along with this quickstart, you'll need access to a Looker (Google Cloud core) instance that includes the sample LookML project. The sample project includes the prebuilt **Intermediate Ecommerce** Explore that is used in this quickstart.
You'll also need to have a the following Looker permissions on your Looker (Google Cloud core) instance (or a Looker role that includes these permissions):
  * `access_data`: Access the sample data in the **Intermediate Ecommerce** Explore.
  * `explore`: Access the Explore page and run queries in the **Intermediate Ecommerce** Explore.
  * `save_looks` (and its parent permission, `save_content`): Save the visualization as a Look.
  * `see_looks`: View the Look that you'll create in this quickstart.


## Navigate to the Explore
To navigate to the **Intermediate Ecommerce** Explore, follow these steps:
  1. In Looker, click **Main menu** menu to expand the main navigation menu.
  2. In the main navigation menu, select **Explore**.
  3. Expand **Z) Sample LookML** (or the corresponding model name on your instance) to expand the list of Explores.
  4. Click **2) Intermediate Ecommerce** Explore to open the Explore page.


## Select fields and pivot data
To build the query, follow these steps:
  1. In the field picker, expand the **Order Items** section.
  2. In the **Dimensions** section of the field picker, expand **Created At Date** , and then hold your cursor over the **Week** field and select the **Pivot data** icon to display the weeks as columns in the results table.
  3. Expand **Other Dates** , and then select the **Shipped to Delivered Days** field to show how long it took each order to be delivered after it was shipped.
  4. In the **Measures** section of the field picker, select the **# of Order Items** field to show the total number of order items for each combination of week and shipping duration.


## Add filters and run the query
Next, you will add filters on the following fields to refine the query results:
  * **Created At Week** : The filter on this field will have the condition `is in the last 8 weeks`, which includes only data from the past 8 weeks.
  * **Shipped to Delivered Days** : 
    * The first filter on this field will have the condition `is not null`, which excludes null values.
    * The second filter on this field will have the condition `is >2`, which includes only shipping durations that are longer than 2 days.


To apply these filters to your query, follow these steps:
  1. For each filter, in the **Filters** section of the Explore page, click **+ Filter** to open the **Add Filter** window.
  2. In the **Add Filter** window, create each filter by selecting the appropriate condition and adding filter values as needed: 
     * For the first filter, select the **Created At Week** field and choose the **is in the last** condition. In the text input field, enter the value `8`, and select **weeks** from the list of timeframes.
     * For the next filter, select the **Shipped to Delivered Days** field and choose the **is not null** condition.
     * For the final filter, select the **Shipped to Delivered Days** field. For the filter condition, select **is >**. In the text input field, enter the value `2`.
  3. Click **Run** to run the query and display the results.


The **Data** section of the Explore now shows the number of order items for each shipping duration over the past eight weeks.
## Customize the visualization
Before saving the visualization as a Look, change the default chart type to a table chart and apply conditional formatting to highlight potential shipping delays. To make these changes, follow these steps:
  1. In the **Visualization** section of the Explore page, click the **Visualizations** bar to open the visualization editor.
  2. In the **Visualization** menu, select **Table** to display the query results as a table chart.
  3. Click **Edit** tune to open the visualization editor.
  4. In the **Series** tab, expand **Order Items # of Items** and disable the **Cell Visualization** option.
  5. In the **Formatting** tab of the visualization editor, confirm that the **Enable conditional formatting** option is enabled.
  6. In the **Rules** section of the **Formatting** tab, if there is an existing conditional formatting rule, replace the default conditions with the following conditions. If there are no rules, click **Add a Rule** to create a new custom formatting rule and apply the following conditions.
     * In the **Apply to** section, choose **Select fields...** and enter the **Order Items # of Order Items** field in the text input field.
     * In the **Format** section, choose the **If value is greater than** condition and enter the value `200`.
     * In the **Styles** section, select the existing color swatch in the **Background color** section, and then select a background color (in this example, select the color red).
  7. Click **Add Rule** to save the conditional formatting rule.


Now that you've customized the visualization and applied conditional formatting, Looker highlights cells in the table chart where more than 200 order items took more than two days to be delivered.
## Save the visualization as a Look
To save the table chart as a Look, follow these steps:
  1. Click the **Explore actions** gear icon settings in the Explore header.
  2. Select **Save...** , and then select **As a Look**.
  3. In the **Save Look** window, enter a title for the Look in the **Title** field.
  4. In the **Folder** section, choose a folder to save the Look to.
  5. Click **Save** to save the Look to that folder, or click **Save & View Look** to save and immediately open the Look.


Now that you've saved the visualization as a Look, you can access it again for further analysis, share it with others, or incorporate it into dashboards for broader visibility. You can also use the Look in a dashboard, as described in the Build a dashboard with sample data.
