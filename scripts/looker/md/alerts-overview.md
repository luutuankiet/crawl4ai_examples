With alerts, you can specify conditions in your data that, when met or exceeded, trigger a notification to be sent to specific recipients at a desired frequency.
## Alerts overview
Alerts are set on query-based or Look-linked tiles on dashboards. Based on the alert's frequency, Looker checks whether each alert's conditions have been met or exceeded; if so, Looker notifies users of this change.
In addition to creating alerts, users can view, duplicate, and follow some alerts created by other users, depending on their permissions. Alert conditions will also take into account any dashboard filters that exist when the alert is created.
## Alerts documentation
See the following links for documentation that is relevant to the Admin role and to all Looker users.
