  * Using components


Looker's component library allows applications to leverage Looker's design elements, UI patterns, and data visualizations, all through the interface of React components. Some examples of components include forms, buttons, filter inputs, pagination controls, layouts, line charts, bar charts, scatterplot charts, tables, and more.
While quick time-to-value is one of the strengths of components, where they really shine is in enabling more seamless experiences between Looker and custom-built applications.
Some common use cases include:
  * Creating Looker-like UI, such as page navigation, within a Looker extension
  * Creating Looker-like UI, such as dashboard filters, around embedded Looker content
  * Delivering a lighter-weight individual visualization within an embedded analytics application without the full experience of an iframe embed


## Using components
