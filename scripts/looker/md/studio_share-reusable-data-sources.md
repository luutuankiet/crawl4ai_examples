#  Share reusable data sources
Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 
> This article applies to reusable data sources. Embedded data sources are shared when you share the report in which they are embedded. Learn more about the types of data sources.
To share a reusable data source, use the Looker Studio home page:
  1. Sign in to Looker Studio.
  2. In the top, select **Data sources**.
  3. Locate the data source you want to share, then on the right, click More .
  4. Click **Share**. The _Share with others_ dialog appears.
  5. Under **Add people** , enter the names or email addresses of the people with whom you want to share. You can also share with Google Groups.
  6. Select the access permission for the people and groups you've specified:
     * **Can edit** : Users can edit the asset and share it with others.
     * **Can view** : Users can see the asset and share it with others, but can't edit it.
  7. To set different permissions for different people, click **Manage access**.
  8. By default, people you invite receive an email with a link to the asset you're sharing. Uncheck **Notify people** to not send that email.
  9. Click **Send**.


## How sharing data sources works
  * Sharing a data source never grants access to the underlying data set.
  * A Google login is required to view or edit a data source.
  * Sharing a data source with view permission allows the viewer to see the schema (structure) of the data source, but not change it.
  * Sharing a data source with edit permission allows editors to change the schema: they can rename and disable fields, add calculated fields, change data type and default aggregation, and add descriptions.
  * Only the data source owner can edit the data source connection.
