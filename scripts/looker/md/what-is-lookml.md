LookML, short for _Looker Modeling Language_ , is the language that is used in Looker to create semantic data models. You can use LookML to describe dimensions, aggregates, calculations, and data relationships in your SQL database. Looker uses a model that is written in LookML to construct SQL queries against a particular database.
LookML is a dependency language like _make_ , as opposed to an imperative language like C or Ruby. LookML provides predefined data types and syntax for data modeling. You don't need prior experience with programming languages to understand LookML. LookML is independent of particular SQL dialects, and it encapsulates SQL expressions to support any SQL implementation.
For data analysts, LookML fosters DRY style ("don't repeat yourself"), meaning you write SQL expressions _once, in one place,_ and Looker uses the code repeatedly to generate ad hoc SQL queries. Business users can then use the results to build complex queries in Looker, focusing only on the content they need, not the complexities of SQL structure.
## LookML projects
LookML is defined in _projects_. A LookML project is a collection of files including at least model and view files, and optionally other types of files, that are typically version-controlled together through a Git repository. The model files contain information about which tables the project will use and how the tables should be joined. The view files describe how information is calculated about each table (or across multiple tables if the joins permit this).
LookML separates structure from content, so the query structure (how tables are joined) is independent of the query content (the columns to access, derived fields, aggregate functions to compute, and filtering expressions to apply).
Looker queries are based on LookML project files. Data analysts use LookML to create and maintain data models that define the data structure and business rules for the data that is being analyzed. The Looker SQL generator translates LookML into SQL, which lets business users query without writing any LookML or SQL.
Business users use the Looker query builder, or the Explore interface, to create queries that are based on the data model that Looker analysts define. Users can select dimensions, measures, and filters to create custom queries that are based on their own questions and to generate their own insights.
When a user creates a query, it is sent to the Looker SQL generator, which translates the query into SQL. The SQL query is executed against the database, and then Looker returns the formatted results to the user in the Explore interface. The user can then visualize the results and generate insights.
For more details on the fundamental LookML elements in a project and how they relate to one another, see LookML terms and concepts.
## What users see
How the project is set up, and the specific contents of its files, determines what users see and how they can interact with Looker.
  1. The Explore panel in the left navigation panel is organized by model names. Under each model name is a list of available Explores that are defined in that model.
  2. Users can search for a specific Explore.
  3. Developers can define descriptions for Explores, which users can view by hovering over the Explore name in the **Explore** menu.
  4. The field picker pane is organized by view names. Under each view name is a list of available fields from the tables included in that view. Most views show both dimensions and measures. This example selects a **Month** dimension from within a **Returned Date** dimension group, which was defined in the view file.
  5. Users can select multiple measures on which to base the query.
  6. Users can apply options like filters and pivots in the field picker pane.
  7. Users can refine the terms of the query.
  8. Users can choose a visualization type to apply to the query results.
  9. Running this Explore generates a SQL query that returns both a data table and a visualization of the total sale price and total gross margin of the returned orders from the past year.


## Code sample
The following code example shows a minimal LookML project for an e-commerce store, which has a model file — `ecommercestore.model.lkml` — and two view files — `orders.view.lkml` and `customers.view.lkml`:
```
######################################
# FILE: ecommercestore.model.lkml    #
# Define the explores and join logic #
######################################
connection: order_database
include: "*.view.lkml"
explore: orders {
  join: customers {
    sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.id} ;;
  }
}

##########################################################
# FILE: orders.view.lkml                                 #
# Define the dimensions and measures for the ORDERS view #
##########################################################
view: orders {
  dimension: id {
    primary_key: yes
    type: number
    sql: ${TABLE}.id ;;
  }
  dimension: customer_id {      # field: orders.customer_id
    sql: ${TABLE}.customer_id ;;
  }
  dimension: amount {           # field: orders.amount
    type: number
    value_format: "0.00"
    sql: ${TABLE}.amount ;;
  }
  dimension_group: created {                # generates fields:
    type: time                              # orders.created_time, orders.created_date
    timeframes: [time, date, week, month]   # orders.created_week, orders.created_month
    sql: ${TABLE}.created_at ;;
  }
  measure: count {             # field: orders.count
    type: count                # creates a sql COUNT(*)
    drill_fields: [drill_set*] # list of fields to show when someone clicks 'ORDERS Count'
  }
  measure: total_amount {
    type: sum
    sql: ${amount} ;;
  }
  set: drill_set {
    fields: [id, created_time, customers.name, amount]
  }
}

#############################################################
# FILE: customers.view.lkml                                 #
# Define the dimensions and measures for the CUSTOMERS view #
#############################################################
view: customers {
  dimension: id {
    primary_key: yes
    type: number
    sql: ${TABLE}.id ;;
  }
  dimension: city {                    # field: customers.city
    sql: ${TABLE}.city ;;
  }
  dimension: state {                   # field: customers.state
    sql: ${TABLE}.state ;;
  }
  dimension: name {
    sql: CONCAT(${TABLE}.firstname, " ", ${TABLE}.lastname) ;;
  }
  measure: count {             # field: customers.count
    type: count                # creates a sql COUNT(*)
    drill_fields: [drill_set*] # fields to show when someone clicks 'CUSTOMERS Count'
  }
  set: drill_set {                     # set: customers.drill_set
    fields: [id, state, orders.count]  # list of fields to show when someone clicks 'CUSTOMERS Count'
  }
}

```
