The data in your reports comes from a data source. This page shows you how to add new and existing data sources to your reports.
## Add data to a new report
When you first create a new report, you'll be asked to add data to it. You can create a new embedded data source or add an existing data source:
  1. Sign in to Looker Studio.
  2. Click **Create** , and then select **Report**.
  3. The **Add data to report** menu appears, which includes two tabs: 
     * The **Connect to data** tab lets you create a new data source.
     * The **My data sources** lets you add an existing data source.


### Create or embed a new data source
  1. In the **Connect to data** tab, select the type of data that you want to connect to or embed.
  2. Select the specific dataset and provide your authorization, if necessary.
  3. Click **Add**.


The new data source is embedded in your report.
### Add an existing data source
  1. In the **My data sources** tab, select the type of data that you want to connect to or embed.
  2. In the bottom right, click **Add**.


The report editor appears, and a chart connected to your data source is placed on the canvas.
## Add data to an existing report
You can add more data sources to existing reports with the **Add data** button:
  1. Edit your report.
  2. In the toolbar, click **Add data**.
  3. Follow the steps shown previously to select an existing data source or to create a new embedded data source.

Data sources that you create from the home page can be used across multiple reports. To create a reusable data source, follow these steps:
  1. Sign in to Looker Studio.
  2. Click **Create** , and then select **Data source**.
  3. Select the type of data that you want to connect to or embed.
  4. Select the specific dataset and provide your authorization, if necessary.
