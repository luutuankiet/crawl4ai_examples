#  Step 2: Add people to the subscription
Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 
A Looker Studio Pro subscription can include specific users as well as Google Groups.
You can also enable the **Trusted Orgs** feature to add users from other organizations to your Pro subscription. To enable the **Trusted Orgs** feature, follow these steps:
  * Subscribe to Looker Studio Pro.
  * Obtain a valid support contract.
  * Submit a request to Cloud Customer Care to enable the **Trusted Orgs** feature. Your request must include the customer domains and the customer organization IDs that you would like to add.


## Add specific users and groups
To add an individual user to the Looker Studio Pro subscription, enter their email address. To add a team, enter a Google Group alias. Each Pro user must be a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity user with a Managed Google account to subscribe to or use Looker Studio Pro.
You must have the proper permissions to view a group's members to add that group. However, you don't need to be a member of the group. See the Set permissions for managing members and content article for more information.
### Limitations
When you're adding users and groups to the Looker Studio Pro subscription, you need to be aware of the following limitations:
  * **You can assign licenses only to users who are inside your organization**. Users from outside your organization can't be included in the subscription. Any external users in a Google Group are excluded from the subscription.
  * **Google Cloud users aren't automatically included in your Pro subscription.** If you've already assigned users to the Google Cloud project associated with Looker Studio, those users won't automatically be added to the Pro subscription. You'll need to add each user or Google Group individually, or you can add your entire organization to the subscription.
  * **Adding identity mapped groups is not supported.** Make sure to add only users or Google groups.


## Add everyone in your organization's domain
You can buy individual Pro licenses for everyone in your organization by selecting **Add everyone in your organization's domain**.
