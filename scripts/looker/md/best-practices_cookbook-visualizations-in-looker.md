#  Looker cookbook: Getting the most out of Looker visualizations
Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 
Simple and concise visualizations are a powerful way to display data trends and help users make meaningful data-driven actions to maximize impact. For example, dashboards are a great tool for telling stories about data — but users don't always have the time to process and distill information that is presented across many dashboard tiles.
This cookbook contains a series of use cases (referred to in the Looker cookbooks as "recipes") for customizing and condensing data points in Looker visualizations. The following table lists these recipes, which let users more quickly and efficiently consume impactful information.
Additional helpful visualization references are linked in the Visualization resources section on this page.
