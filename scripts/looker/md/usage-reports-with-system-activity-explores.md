Looker admins and users who have been granted the `see_system_activity` permission have access to Looker's System Activity Explores in the **Explore** menu.
The System Activity Explores connect to Looker's underlying application database. They show information about your Looker instance, including Looks and dashboards saved on your instance, user information, historical query information, and instance performance statistics. Both the granularity and retention of System Activity data are subject to system constraints. System Activity is designed for collecting high-volume data, and aggregating it can be used to supplement your business logs.
By default, System Activity data is stored in Looker's internal database. Most tables are truncated on a regular schedule to comply with storage limits. For example, the History table is truncated to the past 90 days of data. Some tables have more stringent data retention policies. To increase data retention, consider using Elite System Activity.
It is not possible to query System Activity data using SQL Runner as permissions for Looker's internal database are limited.

## Using the System Activity Explores
Following are some examples of how you can use some of the Explores in System Activity, along with the answers to some common questions. You can access the example Explores in this section by replacing `<instance_name.looker.com>` in the example URLs with the address of your Looker instance.
### API Usage
The **API Usage** Explore provides a summary of the volume of API calls made to your Looker instance.
You can use the **API Usage** Explore to answer questions like the following:
  * How can I get a daily audit of API calls?
  * How many total API calls have been made on my instance this year?


#### How can I get a daily audit of API calls?
You can use the **API Usage** Explore to retrieve a list of all API calls made on your instance for any given time period. To see which calls were made on a given day:
  1. Select **Endpoint** from **API Usage**.
  2. Select **Total Usage** from **API Usage**.
  3. Filter on **Created Date** from **API Usage** with the selected date.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/api_usage?fields=api_usage.endpoint,api_usage.total_usage&f[api_usage.created_date]=yesterday&sorts=api_usage.total_usage+desc&limit=500&column_limit=50&vis=%7B%7D&filter_config=%7B%22api_usage.created_date%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22advanced%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%7B%22constant%22%3A%22yesterday%22%2C%22unit%22%3A%22day%22%7D%2C%7B%7D%5D%2C%22id%22%3A5%2C%22error%22%3Afalse%7D%5D%7D&origin=share-expanded

```

Check the Looker API Reference or Looker API Explorer for more information about what each API call does.
#### How many API calls have been made on my instance this year?
You can use the **API Usage** Explore to aggregate the volume of API calls over any timeframe. For example, you can create a yearly report that shows how many API calls were made each month:
  1. Select **Created Month** from **API Usage**.
  2. Select **Total Usage** from **API Usage**.
  3. Filter on **Created Year** from **API Usage** with the selected year.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/api_usage?fields=api_usage.total_usage,api_usage.created_month&fill_fields=api_usage.created_month&f[api_usage.created_year]=last+year&sorts=api_usage.created_month+desc&limit=500&column_limit=50&vis=%7B%7D&filter_config=%7B%22api_usage.created_year%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22advanced%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%7B%22constant%22%3A%22last+year%22%2C%22unit%22%3A%22yr%22%7D%2C%7B%7D%5D%2C%22id%22%3A6%2C%22error%22%3Afalse%7D%5D%7D&origin=share-expanded

```

### Content Usage
The **Content Usage** Explore in System Activity provides information about Look and dashboard usage, including frequency of views, favoriting, scheduling, and access through the API. It also includes details about individual Looks and dashboards.
#### Quick Start analyses
The **Content Usage** Explore includes Quick Start analyses, which you can use to quickly answer questions or as starting points for other queries.
Select a Quick Start analysis tile in a blank Explore, or from the lightning bolt **Quick Start** menu in an Explore that has run, and Looker will show a query with fields that are preselected and sorted to answer one of the following questions:
  * Which content has been favorited the most times?
  * Which content has been accessed in the previous 3 days?
  * Which content has not been accessed in the past 60 days?
  * Which content has been accessed most frequently using the Looker API?
  * Which dashboards created in the past 7 days are used the most?
  * Which Looks created in the past 7 days are used the most?
  * Which boards have been favorited the most times?
  * Which content has been viewed the most times?


#### What filters are used by popular Looks and dashboards?
You can use the **Content Usage** Explore to find the most popular Looks or dashboards on your instance. You can then use the **History** Explore to identify the filters used by popular Looks or dashboards. To find the most popular Looks or dashboards:
  1. In the **Content Usage** Explore, select **Content ID** , **Content Title** , and **Content Type** from the **Content Usage** view.
  2. Add a filter on **Content Type** from the **Content Usage** view, and set the filter value to `dashboard OR look`.
  3. Select **View Total** from **Content Usage**. You can also select fields like **Favorites Total** , **Schedule Total** , **API Total** , and **Embed Total** from the **Content Usage** view.
  4. Sort the results in descending order on **View Total** to list the most popular content first.
  5. You can also add a filter on the **Days Since Last Accessed** field from the **Content Usage** view to limit the data to a specific length of time. For example, you can limit the data you view to the last 30 days by setting the filter value to `is less than 30`.


Then, you can use the **History** Explore to find the filters used in a specific Look or dashboard:
  1. In the **History** Explore, filter on the **ID** field from either the **Dashboard** view or the **Look** view, and enter the IDs for the dashboards or Looks you identified using the **Content Usage** Explore.
  2. Select **Filters** from the **Query** view to return a list of filters used by the dashboards or Looks you are filtering on.


### Dashboard
The **Dashboard** Explore includes details about dashboards and dashboard elements, including Looks, queries, roles, users, and folders that are associated with dashboards.
#### Quick Start analyses
The **Dashboard** Explore includes Quick Start analyses, which you can use to quickly answer questions or as starting points for other queries.
Select a Quick Start analysis tile in a blank Explore, or from the lightning bolt **Quick Start** menu in an Explore that has run, and Looker will show a query with fields that are preselected and sorted to answer one of the following questions:
  * Which dashboards use multiple Explores?
  * Which dashboards have short auto-refresh intervals?
  * How many dashboards are set to run on load?
  * Which dashboards have more than 25 tiles?
  * Which dashboards use the most merge queries?
  * Which dashboards use a particular view or field?
  * Which folders contain which dashboards?
  * What tiles make up an individual dashboard?


### Event
The **Event** Explore includes information about historical events within Looker, including the name, type, and frequency of each event. This Explore also includes information about groups and users who are connected to the events.
Following are some common uses of the **Event** Explore:
  * How can I find and categorize API requests?
  * Is there a way to investigate content updates?
  * How do I view login events?


See the Looker events documentation page for more information about viewing events and common event attributes, and for a list of event types.
#### How can I find and categorize API requests?
You can find all the API requests that have been made and categorize them using the **Event** Explore:
  1. Select the **Name** and **Category** fields from the **Event** view.
  2. Add a filter on **Is API Call (Yes / No)** , and set the filter value to `Yes`.
  3. You can also select fields like **Created Date** from **Event** , and **Name** from **User** , for information about specific API requests.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/event?fields=event.created_date,event.name,event.category,user.name&f[event.is_api_call]=Yes&sorts=event.name&limit=500

```

#### Is there a way to investigate content updates?
You can use the **Event** Explore to investigate content updates by filtering on events that include the word `update`:
  1. Select the **Name** from the **Event** view.
  2. Add a filter on the **Name** field from the **Event** view, and set the filter value to `contains update`.
  3. You can also select other fields to provide more information about each content update, such as **Created Time** from **Event** , and **ID** from **User**.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/event?fields=event.name,user.id,event.created_time&f[event.name]=%25update%25&sorts=event.created_time+desc&limit=500

```

#### How do I view login events?
You can use the **Event** Explore to determine who has logged in to the system with login events. For example:
  1. Add a filter on the **Name** field from the **Event** view, and set the filter value to `login`.
  2. Select the **ID** and **Name** from the **User** view.
  3. Select **Created Time** from the **Event** view.


### Event Attribute
The **Event Attribute** Explore contains the data in the **Event** Explore and provides additional information about the attributes that make up events.
Following are some common uses of the **Event Attribute** Explore:
  * How do I view permission changes?
  * How do I track when Labs features are turned on?
  * When was a project name changed?


For more information about viewing events, common event attributes, and a list of event types, see the Looker events documentation page.
#### How do I view permission changes?
You can use the **Event Attribute** Explore to view permission changes. For example, you can find out when a permission was changed and who changed it:
  1. Select **Created Time** and **Name** from the **Event** view for the time the change was made and the type of event.
  2. Select **Name** and **Value** from **Event Attribute** to return information about the type of change made and either the users whose permissions were changed or the specific permissions that were changed.
  3. Select **ID** and any other fields from **User** for information about the user who made the change.
  4. Filter on **Name** in the **Event** view, setting the value to `user_permission_elevation`.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/event_attribute?fields=event.created_time,user.id,user.name,event_attribute.name,event_attribute.value&f[event.name]=%22user_permission_elevation%22&sorts=event.created_time+desc&limit=500

```

#### How do I track when Labs features are turned on?
You can use the **Event Attribute** Explore to track when Labs features are turned on. For example, select the following fields:
  1. Select **Created Time** from the **Event** field.
  2. Select **Name** and **Value** from the **Event Attribute** field.
  3. Add a filter on **Name** from **Event** , and set the filter value to `update_labs_feature`.
  4. You can also add fields like **ID** or **Name** from **User** to view information about the user who turned on a Labs feature.


In this example, the name of the Labs feature that has been turned on or off is shown in the **Value** field of **Event Attribute** when **Name** from **Event Attribute** has the value `labs_feature_id`. When **Name** from **Event Attribute** has the value `labs_feature_value`, the values `true` and `false` indicate whether the Labs feature was turned on or off.
```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/event_attribute?fields=event.created_time,event_attribute.name,event_attribute.value,user.id&f[event.name]=%22update_labs_feature%22&sorts=event.created_time+desc&limit=500

```

#### When was a project name changed?
You can use the **Event Attribute** Explore to see when the name of a project was changed:
  1. Select **Created Time** and **Name** from the **Event** view.
  2. Select **Name** and **Value** from **Event Attribute**.
  3. Add a filter on **Name** from the **Event** view, and set the filter value to `rename_project_file`.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/event_attribute?fields=event.created_time,event.name,event_attribute.name,event_attribute.value&f[event.name]=%22rename_project_file%22&sorts=event.created_time+desc&limit=500&query_timezone=America%2FLos_Angeles&vis=%7B%7D&filter_config=%7B%22event.name%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22%3D%22%2C%22values%22%3A%5B%7B%22constant%22%3A%22rename_project_file%22%7D%2C%7B%7D%5D%2C%22id%22%3A0%2C%22error%22%3Afalse%7D%5D%7D&origin=share-expanded

```

### History
The **History** Explore provides a record of individual queries. It can be useful for troubleshooting, as it provides details about all the queries run on your instance in the past 90 days.
Following are some common questions about using the **History** Explore:
  * What are all the models used by a dashboard?
  * How can I identify long-running queries?
  * When was the last time someone used SQL Runner?
  * How can I find queries that were killed by the database?
  * What is the most popular dashboard by query count?
  * Which Explores are most popular with different roles?
  * Has anyone queried a specific Explore in the last 90 days?
  * Has anyone used a field from a specific view in the last 90 days?
  * Which queries were initiated from within Google Sheets?


#### Truncation of the History table
Because the size of the **History** table can increase rapidly, Looker automatically deletes records that meet any of the following criteria:
  * The `history.created_time` is more than 90 days in the past.
  * The `history.created_time` is more than 7 days in the past, and the `history.source` is `scheduled_task`.


#### Clarification of select fields
Each field in the **History** Explore has a description to help you understand its purpose. The following table contains more detailed descriptions of certain fields that customers often ask about:
Field name | Description | Possible values  
---|---|---  
Source | The source of a query, such as a Look, an Explore, a scheduled task, an alert, a dashboard, etc. | 
  * `alerts`: The query was initiated from an alert.
  * `api`: The query was initiated using the Looker API.
  * `api3`: The query was initiated using the Looker API.
  * `authenticated_download`: The query was initiated using the Looker Action Hub with a streaming action on a schedule.
  * `dashboard`: The query was initiated from a dashboard. (The query may have been initiated from the UI, from the API, or from a scheduled task.)
  * `dashboard_prefetch`: The query was initiated from a dashboard prefetch.
  * `data-download-api`: This query was initiated from a dashboard download in CSV format.
  * `drill_modal`: The query was initiated when a user drilled into the data.
  * `explore`: The query was initiated from an Explore. (The query may have been initiated from the UI or from the API)
  * `guided_analysis`: The query was created with the Guided analyses in System Activity Labs feature.
  * `internal`: The query was run by Looker to retrieve metadata for internal purposes.
  * `look`: The query was initiated from a Look. (The query may have been initiated from the UI, from the API, or from a scheduled task.)
  * `merge_query`: The query was initiated from a merge query.
  * `private_embed`: The query was initiated from a private embed.
  * `public_url`: The query was initiated from a Look with public access enabled.
  * `regenerator`: The query was initiated by the PDT regenerator.
  * `render_manager_cache`: The query was initiated by a download in PDF or PNG format. This could be a Look or a dashboard.
  * `scheduled_task`: The query was run on a schedule which generated a PDF. (This source does not include scheduled deliveries of non-PDF formats, such as CSV.) 
  * `sql_interface`: The query was initiated by a third-party application using the Open SQL Interface.
  * `sqlrunner`: The query was initiated from SQL Runner.
  * `suggest`: The query was created as a filter suggestions query.

  
Issuer Source | The source of a query, bucketed. | 
  * **Action Hub** : The query was initiated using the Looker Action Hub. This includes the **Source** value `authenticated_download`.
  * **API** : The query was initiated using the Looker API. This includes the **Source** value `api3`.
  * **System** : The query was initiated by Looker without direct user intervention. This includes the **Source** values `alerts`, `data-download-api`, and `scheduled_task`.
  * **User** : The query was initiated by a Looker user. This includes the **Source** values `dashboard`, `drill_modal`, `explore`, `look`, `merge_query`, `private_embed`, `render_manager`, `sqlrunner`, and `suggest`.
  * **Other** : The query does not fit into any of the other buckets. This includes the **Source** value `internal`.

  
Status | The current status of the history event. | 
  * `cache_only_miss`: The query was run with the `cache_only=TRUE` option, and the cache entry was not present.
  * `complete`: The query successfully completed.
  * `error`: The query failed with an error. Include the **Message** field to see error details.
  * `killed`: The query was cancelled by a user, by the database, or by Looker.

  
Query Run Count | This field counts the number of query runs by filtering out History entries where the **Status** field value is `cache_only_miss`. In other words, this field only includes History entries where the **Status** field value is either `complete`, `error`, or `killed`.  | A positive integer.  
#### Quick Start analyses
The **History** Explore includes Quick Start analyses, which you can use to quickly answer questions or as starting points for other queries.
Select a Quick Start analysis tile in a blank Explore, or from the lightning bolt **Quick Start** menu in an Explore that has run, and Looker will show a query with fields that are preselected and sorted to answer one of the following questions:
  * What query sources have been the most active over the past day?
  * Which users have been the most active over the past week?
  * Which user's dashboards are the most popular?
  * How many times has a particular dashboard been used over the past 30 days?
  * What are the most recently run queries?
  * How many times has a particular Look been used over the past 30 days?
  * What are the average query runtimes of individual models?
  * What is the recent query activity for a particular user?


#### What are all the models used by a dashboard?
You can use the **History** Explore to find all the models used by a dashboard. As an example, this could help identify the models for which a user needs permissions when that user is unable to see the data on a dashboard.
  1. Select **ID (Inclusive)** from the **Dashboard** view.
  2. Select **Model** and **Count** from the **Query** view.
  3. Filter on **ID (Inclusive)** , entering the dashboard ID for the dashboard you want to filter on.


In the following URL example, you can replace the dashboard ID `123` in the filter element `f[history.real_dash_id]=123` with the ID for the dashboard you want to filter on:
```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/history?fields=history.real_dash_id,query.model,query.count&f[history.real_dash_id]=123&sorts=history.real_dash_id+desc&limit=500

```

#### How can I identify long-running queries?
Suppose you want to create alerts for long-running queries. You can use the **History** Explore to, for example, find the queries that take the longest to run:
  1. Select **ID** and **Link** from **Query**.
  2. Select **Average Runtime in Seconds** and **Query Run Count** from **History** to view the average length of time each query ran and how many times the query has been run.
  3. You can add a filter on **Completed Date** from **History** , and set the filter value to a timeframe like `is in the past 7 days` to limit the results that are displayed.
  4. Add a filter on **Is Single Query (Yes / No)** and set its value to `is Yes` to exclude merge queries from the results.
  5. You can display only queries with a runtime that is above a certain threshold, such as 5 minutes; to do this, you can filter on **Average Runtime in Seconds** and set the filter value to `is greater than 300`.
  6. Sort in descending order on **Average Runtime in Seconds** from **History** to list queries with the longest average runtimes first.


You can then save the query as a Look and create an alert to notify you if there are queries with runtimes that exceed the threshold you specify.
In the following URL example, you change the timeframe for which results are displayed by replacing `7+days` in the filter element `f[history.created_date]=7+days` with another filter value. You can also change the value of the filter on **Average Runtime in Seconds** by replacing `is greater than 300` in the filter element `f[history.average_runtime]=%3E300`.
```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/history?fields=query.id,history.average_runtime,history.query_run_count,query.link&f[history.is_single_query]=Yes&f[history.created_date]=7+days&f[history.average_runtime]=%3E300&sorts=history.average_runtime+desc&limit=500

```

#### When was the last time someone used SQL Runner?
To determine the last time a specific user ran a SQL Runner query using the **History** Explore:
  1. Select **Last Run Time** and **User ID** from the **SQL Runner Query** view.
  2. Add a filter on **User ID** from the **SQL Runner Query** view, and set the filter value to the ID of the user.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/history?fields=sql_query.last_run_time,sql_query.user_id&sorts=sql_query.last_run_time+desc&limit=500&column_limit=50

```

#### How can I find queries that were killed by the database?
To find queries that were killed by your database with the **History** Explore:
  1. Add a filter on **Message** from **History** , and set the filter value to `contains query killed`.
  2. Select **Created Date** , **ID** , and **Message** from **History**.
  3. Select **ID** from **Query**.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/history?fields=history.id,history.created_date,query.id,history.message&f[history.message]=%25query+killed%25&sorts=history.message&limit=500

```

#### What is the most popular dashboard by query count?
The **Dashboard** Explore lists the titles of every dashboard accessed in the last 90 days and includes a count of the number of times each of those dashboards was accessed:
  1. Select **Title** from **Dashboard**.
  2. Select **Query Run Count** from **History**.
  3. Add a filter on **Title** from **Dashboard** , and set the filter value to `is not null`.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/history?fields=dashboard.title,history.query_run_count&f[dashboard.title]=-NULL&sorts=history.query_run_count+desc&limit=500&column_limit=50

```

#### Which Explores are most popular with different roles?
This Explore shows how many times an Explore was run by each role on your instance in the previous 90 days:
  1. Select **Explore** from **Query**.
  2. Select and pivot on **Name** from **User Role**.
  3. Select **Query Run Count** from **History**.
  4. Add a filter on **Name** from **User Role** , and set the filter value to `is not null`.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/history?fields=history.query_run_count,query.view,role.name&pivots=role.name&f[role.name]=-NULL&sorts=history.query_run_count+desc+0,role.name&limit=500&column_limit=50

```

#### Has anyone queried a specific Explore in the last 90 days?
You can use the **History** Explore to determine if a specific Explore was used in the last 90 days:
  1. Select **Created Date** from **History**.
  2. Select **Explore** and **Link** from **Query**.
  3. Add a filter on **Explore** from **Query** , and enter the name of the Explore.


#### Has anyone used a field from a specific view in the last 90 days?
You can use the **History** Explore to determine if any fields from a specific view were used in the last 90 days:
  1. Select **Created Date** from **History**.
  2. Select **Explore** and **Link** from **Query**.
  3. Filter on **Fields Used** from **Query** , enter the name of the view followed by a period — for example, `orders.` — and select **contains** for the filter condition. The period in your filter indicates that Looker should return fields from only that view and not fields from similarly named views.


In the following URL example, you can replace `order%5E_items.` in the filter element `f[query.formatted_fields]=%25order%5E_items.` with the name of the view you want to filter on, followed by a period:
```

```

### PDT Builds
The **PDT Builds** Explore includes information about PDT builds, including time taken to finish builds and the connection and model the PDTs are part of.
Following are some common uses of the **PDT Builds** Explore:
  * How can I see PDT build times?
  * How can I identify long-running PDTs to alert on?


> These queries may take longer to run on instances with many PDTs running concurrently.
#### How can I see PDT build times?
You can use the **PDT Builds** Explore to view build times for PDTs. For example, to see PDT build times in the past 2 days:
  1. Add a filter on **Start Time** from the **PDT Builds** view and set its value to `is in the past 2 days`.
  2. Select **Start Time** , **View Name** , **Connection** , **Model Name** , **Elapsed Minutes** , and **Elapsed Seconds** from the **PDT Builds** view.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/pdt_builds?fields=pdt_builds.start_time,pdt_builds.view_name,pdt_builds.connection,pdt_builds.model_name,pdt_builds.elapsed_minutes,pdt_builds.elapsed_seconds&f[pdt_builds.start_time]=2+days&sorts=pdt_builds.start_time+desc&limit=500

```

#### How can I identify long-running PDTs to alert on?
You can use the **PDT Builds** Explore to identify long-running PDTs. Then, you can save the query as a Look and create an alert to notify you if there are PDTs with build times that exceed the threshold you specify.
For example, to see PDTs with an average build time of more than 30 minutes:
  1. Add a filter on **Average Build Time Minutes** from the **PDT Builds** view and set its value to `is greater than 30`.
  2. Select **View Name** , **Connection** , and **Average Build Time Minutes** from the **PDT Builds** view.


To change the value of the filter on **Average Build Time Minutes** from **PDT Builds** , replace `30` in the filter element `f[pdt_builds.average_build_time_minutes]=%3E20` with a number of minutes:
```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/pdt_builds?fields=pdt_builds.view_name,pdt_builds.connection,pdt_builds.average_build_time_minutes&f[pdt_builds.average_build_time_minutes]=%3E30&sorts=pdt_builds.average_build_time_minutes+desc&limit=500

```

### Query Concurrency
The **Query Concurrency** Explore provides a detailed analysis of query concurrency on your instance. You can use this Explore to understand how many queries from different sources are running simultaneously over specific time intervals. This Explore can help you identify periods of high load and investigate performance bottlenecks related to database connection limits.
#### Analyze query concurrency over time
You can use the **Query Concurrency** Explore to visualize the number of queries that are running at the same time and to drill down into specific time buckets for further analysis.
To view concurrency trends over time, follow these steps:
  1. Navigate to the **Query Concurrency** Explore.
  2. Add the **Time Bucket Start Time** dimension from the **Concurrency** view.
  3. Add the **Concurrency** measure from the **Concurrency** view.
  4. Pivot by the **Source** dimension from the **Query Intervals** view to segment concurrency by the query source.
  5. Add filters as needed, such as **Connection Name** , **Date Range** , and **Bucket Size (in minutes)**.
  6. Choose a stacked column or area chart visualization to view the concurrency trends over time.


To investigate a specific period of high concurrency, follow these steps:
  1. From the data table or visualization, click a value from the **Concurrency** measure.
  2. From the drill-down menu, choose the **Timeline Summary of Bucket** option.


#### Limitations with MySQL backends
On Looker instances with a MySQL backend that are not using Elite System Activity, an error may occur if the selected **Date Range** and **Bucket Size** values generate too many buckets. If you encounter the error `Recursive query aborted after N iterations`, reduce the **Date Range** or increase the **Bucket Size** to stay within the database configured limit.
The resulting visualization will show a timeline of every query that was running during that specific time bucket, allowing you to see the exact start and end times of each job that contributed to the total concurrency.
### Query Performance Metrics
The **Query Performance Metrics** Explore provides detailed breakdowns of each query that is run from your Looker instance.
For example, you can use this Explore to investigate which components of a query took longest to load. You can also use this Explore to identify query performance trends and anomalies. For a more detailed breakdown of the query lifecycle and the fields tracked in this Explore, see the Understanding query performance metrics documentation page.
#### Quick Start analyses
The **Query Performance** Explore includes Quick Start analyses, which you can use to quickly answer questions or as starting points for other queries.
Select a Quick Start analysis tile in a blank Explore, or from the lightning bolt **Quick Start** menu in an Explore that has run, and Looker will show a query with fields that are preselected and sorted to answer one of the following questions:
  * How much time did each query stage take?
  * Which Explores have the highest average main query execution time?
  * Which users have the highest average main query execution time?
  * Which times of day have the longest asynchronous worker timings?
  * Which times of day have the longest query initialization timings?
  * Which times of day have the longest connection handling timings?
  * Which times of day have the longest main query timings?
  * Which times of day have the longest post-query timings?


### SQL Query
The **SQL Query** Explore includes information about the SQL queries that have run, including how recently and frequently, and details about users who have run them.
You can use the **SQL Query** Explore to answer questions like the following:
  * Which users run the most SQL queries?


#### Which users run the most SQL queries?
You can use the **SQL Query** Explore to identify the users who run the most SQL Runner queries:
  1. Select **ID** and **Name** from **User**.
  2. Select **Count** from **SQL Runner Query**.
  3. Sort in descending order on **Count** from **SQL Runner Query** to list users who run the most queries first.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/sql_query?fields=sql_query.count,user.id,user.name&sorts=sql_query.count+desc&limit=500

```

### Scheduled Plan
The **Scheduled Plan** Explore includes information about all scheduled data deliveries, including both previously scheduled jobs and future scheduled jobs.
Following are some common questions about using the **Scheduled Plan** Explore:
  * How do I view scheduled plans in a consistent time zone?
  * At which stage do schedules get stuck?
  * How do I find schedule owners?
  * Which scheduled plans run at the same time?
  * Which schedules are unlimited?
  * Is it possible to view history for more than 50 schedules?
  * How do I filter results down to a specific set of schedules?
  * Can error trends be identified across schedules?
  * How do I view runtime metrics for schedules?


#### How do I view scheduled plans in a consistent time zone?
You can use the **Scheduled Plan** to view all scheduled plans in a consistent time zone, since System Activity stores time-based data in the System time zone:
  1. Select **ID** , **Name** , and **Next Runtime** from **Scheduled Plan** to view the next runtime for each scheduled plan in the System time zone.
  2. Select **ID** and **Name** from **User** to see the user who created the schedule.
  3. Filter on **Run Once (Yes/No)** , and set the filter value to `No` to exclude deliveries that were sent once (for example, for a delivery of a Look) or sent as a one-time test (for example, for the test delivery of a Look).
  4. You can also add fields like **Cron Schedule** and **Timezone** from the **Scheduled Plan** view.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_plan.id,scheduled_plan.name,user.id,scheduled_plan.next_run_time,scheduled_plan.cron_schedule,scheduled_plan.timezone,user.name&f[scheduled_plan.run_once]=No&sorts=scheduled_plan.timezone+desc&limit=500&column_limit=50

```

#### At which stage do schedules get stuck?
You can use the **Scheduled Plan** Explore to identify the stage at which schedules get stuck. For example:
  1. To view the stage at which a specific scheduled job got stuck, filter on **ID** from **Scheduled Job** , and set the filter value to the scheduled job's ID. Select **Stage** , **Scheduled Job ID** , and **Runtime in Seconds** from **Scheduled Job Stage**.
  2. You can also select **Started Time** and **Completed Time** from **Scheduled Job Stage**.


You can then use the **ID** and **Runtime in Seconds** fields to troubleshoot the failed job, based on whether the scheduled job was stuck in, for example, the `execute` stage or the `enqueued for delivery` stage.
In the following URL example, you can replace the scheduled job ID `12913` in the filter element `&f[scheduled_job.id]=12913` with the ID for the scheduled job you want to filter on:
```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_job_stage.stage,scheduled_job_stage.scheduled_job_id,scheduled_job_stage.runtime,scheduled_job_stage.started_time,scheduled_job_stage.completed_time&f[scheduled_job.id]=12913&sorts=scheduled_job_stage.scheduled_job_id+desc&limit=500

```

#### How do I find schedule owners?
You can use the **Scheduled Plan** Explore to find schedule owners:
  1. Select **ID** and **Name** from **Scheduled Plan**.
  2. Select **ID** and **Name** from **User**.
  3. Filter on **Run Once (Yes/No)** , and set the filter value to `No` to exclude deliveries that were sent once (for example, for a delivery of a Look) or sent as a one-time test (for example, for the test delivery of a Look).
  4. To find the owner of a specific schedule, filter on **ID** from **Scheduled Plan** , and set the filter value to the ID of that schedule.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_plan.id,scheduled_plan.name,user.id,user.name&f[scheduled_plan.run_once]=No&sorts=scheduled_plan.id&limit=500

```

#### Which scheduled plans run at the same time?
You can use the **Scheduled Plan** Explore to identify plans that are scheduled to run at the same time:
  1. Select **ID** , **Name** , **Cron Schedule** , and **Next Run Time** from **Scheduled Plan**.
  2. Filter on **Run Once (Yes/No)** , and set the filter value to `No` to exclude deliveries that were sent once (for example, for a delivery of a Look) or sent as a one-time test (for example, for the test delivery of a Look).
  3. You can also add a filter on **Next Run Time** , and set the filter value to `is not null` to include only existing scheduled deliveries in the results.


You can then change the timing of schedules (for example, for the delivery of a Look) so that multiple schedules will not run at the same time.
```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_plan.id,scheduled_plan.name,scheduled_plan.cron_schedule,scheduled_plan.next_run_time&f[scheduled_job.run_once]=No&f[scheduled_plan.next_run_time]=NOT+NULL&sorts=scheduled_plan.id&limit=500

```

#### Which schedules are unlimited?
You can use the **Scheduled Plan** Explore to find unlimited schedules, or schedules with a row limit of `-1`:
  1. Filter on **Send All Results** , and set the value to **Yes**.
  2. Select **ID** , **Created Time** , **Finalized Time** , and **Count** from **Scheduled Job**.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_job.id,scheduled_job.created_time,scheduled_job.finalized_time,scheduled_job.count&f[scheduled_plan.send_all_results]=Yes&sorts=scheduled_job.created_time+desc&limit=500

```

#### Is it possible to view history for more than 50 schedules?
Using the **Scheduled Plan** Explore, you can view the histories of more than just the 50 schedules that are available to view on the **Schedule History** admin page. For example:
  1. Select **ID** from **Scheduled Plan**.
  2. Select **Name** from **User** to see who created each schedule.
  3. Select **Cron Schedule** from **Scheduled Job** to see the scheduled delivery time for each scheduled job as a cron string.
  4. Select **Type** from **Scheduled Plan Destination** to see the destination type (for example, for the delivery of a Look).
  5. Select **ID** , **Status** , and **Status Detail** from **Scheduled Job** to view the status and any error messages for each scheduled job.
  6. Select **Created Time** and **Finalized Time** from **Scheduled Job**.
  7. Select **Runtime in Seconds** from **Scheduled Job Stage**.
  8. You can also select **Link** from either the **Look** view or the **Dashboard** view for a link to the Look or dashboard for a schedule.
  9. To limit results to only a specific timeframe, add a filter on **Created Date** from **Scheduled Job** , and set the filter value to a specific length of time, such as `is in the past 7 days`.
  10. Filter on **Run Once (Yes/No)** , and set the filter value to `No` to exclude deliveries that were sent once (for example, for a delivery of a Look) or sent as a one-time test (for example, for the test delivery of a Look).

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_plan.id,user.name,scheduled_job.cron_schedule,scheduled_plan_destination.type,scheduled_job.id,scheduled_job.status,scheduled_job.status_detail,scheduled_job.created_time,scheduled_job.finalized_time,scheduled_job_stage.runtime,look.link,dashboard.link&f[scheduled_plan.run_once]=No&f[scheduled_job.created_date]=7+days&sorts=scheduled_job.created_time+desc&limit=500


```

#### How do I filter results down to a specific set of schedules?
You can use the **Scheduled Plan** Explore to view only a specific set of schedules by filtering, for example, on specific dashboards, owners, or models. For example, to view a list of schedules based on a specific model, such as `thelook`:
  1. Add a filter on **Model** from the **Query** view, and set the filter value to the name of the model.
  2. Select **ID** and **Name** from **Scheduled Plan**.
  3. Select **Name** from **User** to see who created each schedule.
  4. Select **Cron Schedule** from **Scheduled Plan** to see the scheduled delivery time for each schedule as a cron string.
  5. You can also select **Link** from either the **Look** view or the **Dashboard** view for a link to the Look or dashboard for a schedule.
  6. Filter on **Run Once (Yes/No)** , and set the filter value to `No` to exclude deliveries that were sent once (for example, for a delivery of a Look) or sent as a one-time test (for example, for the test delivery of a Look).


In the following URL example, you can replace the model name `thelook` in the filter element `f[query.model]=thelook` with the name of the model you want to filter on:
```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_plan.id,scheduled_plan.name,user.name,scheduled_plan.cron_schedule,look.link,dashboard.link&f[scheduled_plan.run_once]=No&f[query.model]=thelook&sorts=scheduled_plan.id&limit=500

```

#### Can error trends be identified across schedules?
Another use case for the **Scheduled Plan** Explore can be to identify error trends across schedules, such as, for example, finding that SFTP schedules are failing with a specific error message:
  1. Select **Created Time** , **Finalized Time** , **ID** , **Status** , and **Status Detail** from **Scheduled Job** to see a list of scheduled jobs and their statuses and error messages.
  2. Select **Stage** from **Scheduled Job Stage**.
  3. Select **Type** and **Format** from **Scheduled Plan Destination** to see the destination type (for example, for the delivery of a Look) and data format (for example, for the delivery of a Look).
  4. Filter on **Status** from **Scheduled Job** , and set the filter value to `failure` to include only scheduled jobs that have failed.
  5. To include results for only a specific destination, filter on the **Type** field from **Scheduled Plan Destination** , and set the filter value to a specific destination, such as `sftp` or `email`.

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_job.created_time,scheduled_job.finalized_time,scheduled_job.id,scheduled_job.status,scheduled_job.status_detail,scheduled_job_stage.stage,scheduled_plan_destination.type,scheduled_plan_destination.format&f[scheduled_job.status]=failure&sorts=scheduled_job.status&limit=500&column_limit=50

```

#### How do I view runtime metrics for schedules?
You can use the **Scheduled Plan** Explore to investigate runtime metrics for schedules. For example, to view the average runtimes for schedules:
  1. Select **ID** and **Name** from **Scheduled Plan**.
  2. Select **Name** from **User**.
  3. Select **Cron Schedule** from **Scheduled Plan**.
  4. Select **Average Runtime in Seconds** from **Scheduled Job Stage**.
  5. Filter on **Run Once (Yes/No)** , and set the filter value to `No` to exclude deliveries that were sent once (for example, for a delivery of a Look) or sent as a one-time test (for example, for the test delivery of a Look).

```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_plan.id,scheduled_plan.name,user.name,scheduled_plan.cron_schedule,scheduled_job_stage.avg_runtime&f[scheduled_plan.run_once]=No&sorts=scheduled_plan.id&limit=500

```

To see runtimes for scheduled jobs:
  1. To view runtimes for all the jobs for a specific plan, add a filter on **ID** from **Scheduled Plan** , and set the filter value to a specific scheduled plan ID.
  2. Select **ID** from **Scheduled Plan**.
  3. Select **Name** from **User**.
  4. Select **Cron Schedule** from **Scheduled Plan**.
  5. Select **ID** , **Status** , **Created Time** , and **Finalized Time** from **Scheduled Job**.
  6. Select **Runtime in Seconds** from **Scheduled Job Stage**.
  7. Filter on **Run Once (Yes/No)** , and set the filter value to `No` to exclude deliveries that were sent once (for example, for a delivery of a Look) or sent as a one-time test (for example, for the test delivery of a Look).


To change the filter on **ID** from **Scheduled Plan** in the following URL example, replace `145` in the filter element `f[scheduled_plan.id]=145` with the ID of the scheduled plan you want to filter on:
```
https://<instance_name.looker.com>/explore/system__activity/scheduled_plan?fields=scheduled_plan.id,user.name,scheduled_job.cron_schedule,scheduled_job.id,scheduled_job.status,scheduled_job.created_time,scheduled_job.finalized_time,scheduled_job_stage.runtime&f[scheduled_plan.run_once]=No&f[scheduled_plan.id]=145&sorts=scheduled_job.created_time+desc&limit=500

```
