Dashboards can be created in one of two ways. User-defined dashboards are created via the Looker UI, and are described on the Creating user-defined dashboards documentation page. Dashboards can also be created using LookML and their overall settings modified as discussed on this page.
This page describes the LookML dashboard parameters that affect the entire dashboard.
A LookML dashboard also contains _elements_ , which are the data visualizations, text tiles, and buttons on the dashboard. See the Dashboard element parameters page for links to the reference pages for each individual element type.

## `dashboard`
The `dashboard` parameter declares a new dashboard and specifies a name for the dashboard. The maximum number of characters is 255; and allowed characters are letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), and underscores (_). It is typically best practice to place each LookML dashboard in its own LookML file, but it is possible to declare multiple dashboards in a single file.
```
- dashboard: sales_overview

```

To display anything, a dashboard requires at least one element to be added via the `elements` parameter.
## `preferred_viewer`
Before legacy dashboard deprecation in Looker 23.6, the `preferred_viewer` parameter let you choose the format for viewing and downloading a dashboard as either Looker's default dashboard experience or as a legacy dashboard.
##  `title` (for dashboard)
> This section refers to the `title` parameter that is part of a dashboard.
> `title` can also be used as part of a dashboard filter, described on the `title` (for filters) section on this page.
> `title` can also be used as part of any dashboard element. A representative example of its usage is provided on the column chart elements documentation page.
The `title` parameter lets you change how a dashboard name will appear to users in folders and at the top of the dashboard. If not specified, the title defaults to the name of the dashboard. The title text can be localized.
Consider this example:
```
- dashboard: sales_overview
  title: "1) Sales Overview"

```

If you did this, instead of the dashboard appearing as **Sales Overview** , it would appear as **1) Sales Overview**.
##  `description` (for dashboard)
> This section refers to the `description` parameter that is part of a dashboard.
> `description` can also be used as part of an Explore, as described on the `description` (for Explores) parameter documentation page.
> `description` can also be used as part of a field, as described on the `description` (for fields) parameter documentation page.
The `description` parameter lets you add a description to a LookML dashboard.
The contents of the `description` parameter will appear in the **Description** text box of the **Dashboard Details** panel of a LookML dashboard.
The description is displayed under the dashboard title in the lists of dashboards when viewed in a folder set to list view. If a description is not specified, the list displays only the dashboard title.
The description text can be localized.
## `enable_viz_full_screen`
This parameter only takes effect when the **Full Screen Visualizations** Labs feature is enabled by a Looker admin. The **Full Screen Visualization** Labs feature is enabled by default.
The `enable_viz_full_screen` parameter lets you set whether dashboard viewers can see dashboard tiles in full-screen and expanded views. It is equivalent to the **Allow full-screen mode for visualizations** dashboard setting.
This parameter accepts the values `true` (full-screen and expanded views available) and `false` (full-screen and expanded views not available). The default value is `true`.
## `extends`
As described on the Reusing codes with extends documentation page, the `extends` parameter lets you base one LookML dashboard on another LookML dashboard, possibly adding or overriding some settings. The `extends` parameter accepts the name of another LookML dashboard.
> When extending an object, be aware that localization rules apply to your extensions as well. If you are extending an object and then defining new labels or descriptions, you should provide localization definitions in your project's locale strings files. See the Localizing your LookML model documentation page for more information.
## `extension`
As described on the Reusing code with extends documentation page, the `extension` parameter indicates that the dashboard _must_ be extended by another dashboard. This dashboard is never visible to other users but can be used as a template to create other dashboards that are visible to other users. The `extension` parameter only accepts the value `required`. If the `extension` parameter is not included, extension is not required for the dashboard.
## `layout`
The `layout` parameter sets the layout method that Looker will use when positioning dashboard elements. It accepts the following values:
  * **`newspaper`**: Dashboard elements will appear in a 24-column grid. The default size for an element is a width of 8 columns and a height of 6 rows. Elements are configurable along this grid, specified by the`width` , `height`, `row`, and `col` element parameters. This layout option is used when a user-defined dashboard is converted to a LookML dashboard, as well as being the default layout when a new LookML dashboard is created through the Looker IDE. In addition, `newspaper` and `grid` are the only layouts that support conversion from a LookML dashboard to a user-defined dashboard.
  * **`grid`**: Dashboard elements will appear with dynamic widths, which are based on a set of rows that you define with the`rows` parameter and its subparameters `elements` and `height`. `newspaper` and `grid` are the only layouts that support conversion from a LookML dashboard to a user-defined dashboard.
  * **`static`**: Dashboard elements will appear in the order in which they are listed in the LookML file. Each dashboard element must be positioned manually by using the`top` and `left` parameters. These parameters apply to all element types, and details about their usage appear on the documentation pages for each individual visualization type. For representative examples of how `top` and `left` work, see the Column chart parameters for LookML dashboards documentation page. `static` does not support conversion from a LookML dashboard to a user-defined dashboard.
  * **`tile`**: Dashboard elements will appear in the order in which they are listed in the LookML file. The width of the dashboard is dynamic, and is based on the width of the browser. The dashboard elements will dynamically position themselves within the browser to fill the available space.`tile` does not support conversion from a LookML dashboard to a user-defined dashboard.


## `rows`
For `layout: grid` dashboards, the `rows` parameter starts the section of LookML where you define which elements should go into which rows, as well as the height of each row. Within each row, each element has the same width. If you don't list an element in this section it won't appear on the dashboard.
```
- dashboard: sales_overview
  layout: grid
  rows:
    - elements: [element_name, element_name, ...]
      height: 200
    - elements: [element_name, element_name, ...]
      height: 300

```

### `elements`
The `elements` parameter takes a list of dashboard element names, separated by commas. Each `elements` declaration creates a new row in the dashboard. The elements that are placed into a row will all have the same width. So, if you place 2 elements in a row, they will each take 50% of the available space. If you place 4 elements into a row, they will each take 25% of the available space, and so on.
### `height`
The `height` parameter defines the height of a row in pixels. The default value is 300.
## `tile_size`
For `layout: tile` and `layout: static` dashboards, the unit that is used to size and position elements is tile size. You define `tile_size` in pixels, and the default value is 160. For example:
```
- dashboard: sales_overview
  layout: tile
  tile_size: 100

```

In this situation, a dashboard element with `height: 5` and `width: 3` will be 500 pixels high, and 300 pixels wide. The `height` and `width` parameters apply to all element types, and details about their usage appear on the documentation pages for each individual visualization type. For a representative example of how `height` and `width` work, see the Column chart parameters for LookML dashboards documentation page.
## `width`
> This section refers to the `width` parameter that is part of a dashboard.
> `width` can also be used as part of a dashboard element. A representative example its usage is provided on the documentation page for column chart elements.
For `layout: static` dashboards, the `width` parameter defines the total dashboard width that you plan to use in pixels. The `width` parameter will _not_ restrict the dashboard to a certain size if you define too large of an element, or too many elements in a row. Rather, the `width` setting helps to keep the dashboard centered on the screen. If you do not set a width, the default is 1200.
```
- dashboard: sales_overview
  layout: static
  width: 800

```

## `refresh`
> This section refers to the `refresh` parameter that is part of a dashboard.
> `refresh` can also be used as part of a dashboard element. A representative example of its usage is provided on the documentation page for column chart elements.
The `refresh` parameter allows a dashboard to automatically reload on some periodic basis, thereby retrieving fresh data. This is often helpful in settings where a dashboard is constantly displayed, such as on an office TV. Note that the dashboard must be open in a browser window for this parameter to have an effect. This setting does not run in the background to "pre-warm" the dashboard cache.
The refresh rate can be any number (without decimals) of seconds, minutes, hours or days. For example:
```
- dashboard: sales_overview
  refresh: 2 hours

```

Use caution when setting short refresh intervals. Since dashboards can contain many queries, some of which may be resource intensive, certain dashboards may strain your database more than desired.
## `auto_run`
The `auto_run` parameter determines whether a dashboard will run when it is initially opened or reloaded. The default value is `true`. When this parameter is set to `false`, users will need to press a **Run** button to load the dashboard. For example, a dashboard like this will automatically run when opened:
```
- dashboard: sales_overview
  auto_run: true

```

Regardless of the `auto_run` setting, users must always click a **Run** button after changing filter values. This helps to prevent unwanted reloads when a user pauses during a filter change or wants to change multiple filters at the same time.
## `crossfilter_enabled`
The `crossfilter_enabled` parameter lets you turn cross-filters on or off for a dashboard. When this parameter is set to `true`, dashboard viewers can create cross-filters on the dashboard by clicking certain data points.
```
- dashboard: sales_data
  crossfilter_enabled: true

```

## `filters_bar_collapsed`
The `filters_bar_collapsed` parameter lets you set the dashboard filter bar as default collapsed or expanded for a dashboard. When this parameter is set to `true`, the filter bar is default collapsed. Dashboard viewers can expand the filter bar by clicking the filters icon. The default for this setting is `false`.
```
- dashboard: sales_data
  filters_bar_collapsed: true

```

## `filters_location_top`
The `filters_location_top` parameter lets you place the dashboard filter bar at the top or the right for a dashboard. When this parameter is set to `true`, the filter bar appears at the top of the dashboard; when it is set to `false`, the filter bar appears at the right of the dashboard. The default for this setting is `true`.
```
- dashboard: sales_data
  filters_location_top: false

```

## `filters`
> This section refers to the `filters` parameter that is part of a dashboard.
> `filters` can also be used as part of a dashboard element. A representative example of its usage is provided on the documentation page for column chart elements.
> `filters` can also be used as part of a measure, described on the `filters` parameter documentation page.
The `filters` parameter starts the section of LookML where you define dashboard filters. Filters appear at the top of the dashboard and let users change the data behind dashboard elements.
For a filter to impact an element, the element must be set up to "listen" for that filter, using the `listen` parameter. This parameter applies to all element types except `type: text` and `type: button`. For a representative example of how `listen` works, see the Column chart parameters for LookML dashboards documentation page.
When filters are applied to an element in this manner, it's important for the filter type to match the dimension or measure type that is listening for the filter (see Building LookML dashboards for more details). Filters have the following form:
```
filters:
- name: filter_name
  title: "desired filter title"
  type: field_filter | number_filter | date_filter | string_filter
  model: model_name
  explore: explore_name
  field: view_name.field_name
  default_value: Looker filter expression
  allow_multiple_values: true | false
  required: true | false
  listens_to_filters:
  - filter_name
    field: view_name.field_name


```

### `name`
> This section refers to the `name` parameter that is part of a dashboard filter.
> `name` can also be used as part of a dashboard element. A representative example of its usage is provided on the documentation page for column chart elements.
Each `name` declaration creates a new dashboard filter, and assigns a name to it. The name will be referenced in the `listen` parameter of elements that should be impacted by the filter. The `listen` parameter applies to all element types besides `type: text`, and details about its usage appear on the documentation pages for each individual visualization type. For a representative example of how `listen` works, see the Column chart parameters for LookML dashboards documentation page.
```
filters:
- name: order_date

```

###  `title` (for filters)
> This section refers to the `title` parameter that is part of a dashboard filter.
> `title` can also be used as part of a dashboard, as described in the `title` (for dashboard) section on this page.
> `title` can also be used as part of a dashboard element. A representative example of its usage is provided on the Column chart parameters for LookML dashboards documentation page.
The `title` parameter lets you change how a filter name will appear to users at the top of a dashboard. If not specified, the title defaults to the name of the filter.
Consider this example:
```
filters:
- name: order_date
  title: "Order Date(s)"

```

If you did this, instead of the filter appearing as **Order Date** , it would appear as **Order Date(s)**.
### `type`
> This section refers to the `type` parameter that is part of a dashboard filter.
> `type` can also be used as part of a dashboard element, described on the `type` (for LookML dashboards) parameter documentation page.
> `type` can also be used as part of a join, described on the `type` parameter parameter documentation page.
> `type` can also be used as part of a dimension, described on the Dimension, filter, and parameter types documentation page.
> `type` can also be used as part of a measure, described on the Measure types documentation page.
The `type` parameter specifies the type of input that will be placed in the filter. While any type of input (such as a date) could be written into the `type: string_filter` filter, being more specific provides a more tailored filter widget to the user. The 4 types of filter are:
  * **`field_filter`**: Should generally be your default choice, when you can specify an underlying dimension or measure. Using`type: field_filter` and associating the filter with a `type:string` field causes the filter to suggest possible filter values.
  * **`number_filter`**: Lets the user input a number/integer value or expression.
  * **`date_filter`**: Lets the user input a date value or expression.
  * **`string_filter`**: Lets the user input freeform text.


#### `field_filter`
Suggests options to choose from, changes its presentation to users based on the underlying field you specify.
This should be your go-to filter type in situations where you want to make suggestions to users as they interact with the filter. The dimension from which suggestions will be pulled is defined by using the `explore` and `field` parameters, and must be a field of `type: string` to generate filter suggestions.
Please note that suggestions may not work if the field comes from a derived table, if `sql_always_where` is used on the Explore, or if the field is a measure.
```
filters:
- name: order_date
  type: field_filter
  explore: orders
  field: orders.order_date  # must be of the form view_name.dimension_name

```

#### `number_filter`
Does not make suggestions, lets the user enter an integer/number value or expression.
```
filters:
- name: order_value
  type: number_filter

```

#### `date_filter`
Does not make suggestions, lets the user enter a date value or expression.
```
filters:
- name: order_date
  type: date_filter

```

#### `string_filter`
Does not make suggestions, lets the user enter freeform text.
```
filters:
- name: customer_name
  type: string_filter

```

### `default_value`
The `default_value` parameter lets you specify a default value to use for a filter. This value can be helpful to users by suggesting a reasonable starting point.
Make sure to match the default value with the type of filter being used. For example:
```
filters:
- name: order_value
  type: number_filter
  default_value: "50 to 100"

- name: order_date
  type: date_filter
  default_value: "last 30 days"

- name: customer_name
  type: string_filter
  default_value: "John Doe"

```

You can use filter expressions to create default values. The Looker filter expressions documentation page describes this in more detail.
When you use both the `default_value` and the `ui_config` parameters, filter expressions must be compatible with the value given to the `type` subparameter of `ui_config` and the data types that support the `type` value.
You can also use the `_localization` and `_user_attributes` Liquid variables for flexible default filter values.
### `allow_multiple_values`
The `allow_multiple_values` parameter lets you control whether users can select a single filter value or multiple filter values. When this parameter is set to `true` (the default), users can select multiple values for the filter. When this parameter is set to `false`, users are able to select only a single filter value.
For example:
```
filters:
- name: Order ID
  title: Order ID
  type: field_filter
  allow_multiple_values: true
  required: false
  model: thelookstore
  explore: orders
  field: orders.id

```

### `required`
The `required` parameter lets you require that users provide a value for the filter in order to run the dashboard. By default, filters do not require values. If a filter that does not require a value and is left blank, the data simply isn't restricted by the filter field. If a filter that does require a value and is left blank, the dashboard won't run.
```
filters:
  - name: State
    title: State
    type: field_filter
    required: true

```

### `ui_config`
The `ui_config` subparameter of `filters` lets you configure filter settings for a LookML dashboard. These settings include the types of filter controls used, the placement of filter controls, and possible filter values.
For example:
```

  filters:
  - name: City
    title: City
    type: field_filter
    default_value: San Francisco
    allow_multiple_values: true
    required: false
    ui_config:
      type: button_group
      display: inline
      options:
      - San Francisco
      - New York
      - Tokyo
    model: thelook
    explore: order_items
    field: users.city


```

See the Adding and editing user-defined dashboard filters documentation page for more information about configuring filters with the UI.
#### `type`
The `type` subparameter of `ui_config` lets you specify the types of filter controls that are shown.
Depending on the value you enter for `type`, filter controls can be single selection or multiple selection.
> The values that `type` supports depend on the LookML data `type` that is assigned to the field that you're filtering on.
STR = Compatible with the `string` data type  |  DIST = Compatible with the `distance` data type   
---|---  
NUM = Compatible with the `number` data type and numeric measures  |  DUR = Compatible with the `duration` data type   
TIER = Compatible with the `tier` data type  |  D&T = Compatible with most date and time data types   
ZIP = Compatible with the `zipcode` data type  |  LOC = Compatible with the `location` data type   
Y/N = Compatible with the `yesno` data type  |  PAR = Compatible with the `parameter` parameter   
Value | Description | Supported Data Types  
---|---|---  
Multiple Selection  
`button_group` |  The filter shows a group of buttons, with one button for each value specified with the `options` parameter. |  STR NUM TIER ZIP Y/N DIST DUR  
`checkboxes` |  The filter shows checkboxes, with one checkbox for each value specified with the `options` parameter. |  STR NUM TIER ZIP Y/N DIST DUR  
`tag_list` |  The filter shows a drop-down listing each possible value specifed using the `options` parameter. |  STR NUM TIER ZIP DIST DUR  
`range_slider` |  For numeric fields, the filter shows a slider that lets users set a range of numbers as the filter's value. The `min` and `max` subparameters of `options` are used to specify the minimum and maximum possible values for the filter, and the default range can be specified using the `default_value` parameter. |  NUM DIST DUR  
Single Selection  
`button_toggles` |  The filter shows a group of buttons, with one button for each value specified with the `options` parameter. |  STR NUM TIER ZIP Y/N DIST DUR PAR

`dropdown_menu` |  The filter shows a drop-down menu listing each possible value specified using the `options` parameter. The drop-down also provides users with the option to select **Any value**. |  STR NUM TIER ZIP Y/N DIST DUR PAR  
`slider` |  For numeric fields, the filter shows a slider that lets users choose a filter by sliding between the minimum and maximum possible values, which are specified using the `options` parameter. |  NUM DIST DUR  
Dates and Times  
`day_picker` |  The filter lets users choose a particular date to filter on. |  D&T The single day control can be used with most timeframes and time-based types, but viewers can only select single dates with this type of control.  
`day_range_picker` |  The filter lets users select a start date and end date to filter on a range of dates. |  D&T The date range control can be used with most timeframes and time-based types, but viewers can only select date ranges with this type of control.  
`date_time_range_input` |  The filter lets the user filter on a range of dates and times. |  D&T The date and time range control can be used with most time-based types, and viewers must select both date and time options with this type of control.  
`relative_timeframes` |  The filter lets the user filter on a custom range of dates or to choose from timeframe presets like **Today** , **Last 7 Days** , **Last 90 Days** , and so on. |  D&T The timeframe control can be used with most timeframes and time-based types, but viewers cannot select time options with this type of control.  
Other  
`advanced` | The filter presents options for applying one or more filters or advanced matches filters.Using advanced controls section on this page to learn more about advanced controls.  |  STR NUM TIER ZIP Y/N D&T DIST DUR LOC PAR  
#### `display`
You can can use the `display` subparameter of `ui_config` to set the position of a dashboard filter. You can position a filter by assigning one of the following values to `display`:
  * `inline`: The filter is displayed directly in the top bar of the dashboard.
  * `popover`: A summary value appears in the top bar of the dashboard; click the value to see the full filter.
  * `overflow`: A **More** button appears in the top bar of the dashboard with a numeric indicator of how many overflow filters there are; users can click the button to see the overflow filters and their values.


Some filter types can only be displayed in certain ways. For example, filters of `type: day_picker` can only be displayed as `inline` or `overflow`. If you give a filter a `display` value that is not valid for that `type`, the filter will display as either `inline` or `popover`, whichever is valid. To learn more, see the Adding and editing user-defined dashboard filters documentation page.
For information about positioning dashboard filters using the UI, see the Adding and editing user-defined filters documentation page.
#### `options`
The optional `options` subparameter of `ui_config` lets you specify the values that a user can choose from to temporarily update dashboard filter values when users view a LookML dashboard. If you do not specify any values for `options`, Looker pulls the first values from the database.
For example, you can set `San Francisco`, `New York`, and `Tokyo` as the possible values for a filter on the `users.city` field as follows:
```

ui_config:
  type: button_group
  display: inline
  options:
  - San Francisco
  - New York
  - Tokyo


```

If the `type` subparameter of `ui_config` is set to `range_slider` or `slider`, you can use the `min` and `max` subparameters of `options`:
  * `min`: Set the minimum possible value for a filter.
  * `max`: Set the maximum possible value for a filter.


For example:
```

ui_config:
  type: range_slider
  display: inline
  options:
    min: 0
    max: 500


```

### `model`
For dashboard filters of `type: field_filter`, you need to define a model from which the filter will pull suggestions. The `model` parameter specifies which model contains the field you want to use.
```
filters:
- name: State
  title: State
  type: field_filter
  default_value: California
  model: thelookstore
  explore: users
  field: users.state

```

### `explore`
> This section refers to the `explore` parameter that is part of a dashboard filter.
> `explore` can also be used as part of a model, described on the `explore` parameter documentation page.
> `explore` can also be used as part of a dashboard element. A representative example of its usage is provided on the documentation page for column chart elements.
For dashboard filters of `type: field_filter`, you need to define a field from which the filter will pull suggestions. The `explore` parameter specifies which Explore contains the field you want to use.
```
filters:
- name: order_date
  type: field_filter
  explore: orders
  field: orders.order_date

```

### `field`
For dashboard filters of `type: field_filter`, you need to define a field from which the filter will pull suggestions. The `field` parameter specifies which field you want to use. It is important to use the fully scoped field name. In other words, use `view_name.field_name`, not just `field_name`.
```
filters:
- name: order_date
  type: field_filter
  explore: orders
  field: orders.order_date

```

### `listens_to_filters`
For dashboard filters of `type: field_filter`, you can narrow suggestions for the filter based on what the user enters for another filter of `type: field_filter`.
In the following example, the suggestions provided for the `State` filter will be based on the values from the `Order ID` filter. Whatever values are selected for the `Order ID` filter will have associated `users.state` values, and those values will be suggested values for the `State` filter. See the Adding and editing user-defined dashboard filters documentation page for more information.
```
filters:
- name: State
  title: State
  type: field_filter
  model: thelookstore
  explore: users
  listens_to_filters:
  - Order ID
  field: users.state

```

## `embed_style`
The `embed_style` parameter starts the section of LookML where you customize the appearance of an embedded dashboard. `embed_style` and its associated parameters are supported only on embedded dashboards and are ignored if the dashboard is not embedded.
After you make changes to `embed_style`, you must deploy your LookML to production in order to see your `embed_style` settings reflected in the embedded LookML dashboard.
For the following embedded dashboard attributes that specify a color, the color value can be a hex string like `#2ca6cd` or a CSS named color string like `mediumblue`.
Embedded dashboard customizations have the following form:
```
embed_style:
  background_color: "css_color"
  show_title: true | false
  title_color: "css_color"
  show_filters_bar: true | false
  tile_background_color: "css_color"
  tile_text_color: "css_color"

```

### `background_color`
Sets the color of the background of an embedded dashboard.
```
embed_style:
  background_color: "#ffffff"

```

### `show_title`
Specifies whether the embedded dashboard title is visible to users.
```
embed_style:
  show_title: false

```

### `title_color`
Sets the color of the title of an embedded dashboard.
```
embed_style:
  title_color: "#008000"

```

### `show_filters_bar`
Specifies whether the embedded dashboard filters are visible to users.
> This parameter affects only the cosmetic appearance of the dashboard, not a user's ability to access data. Hiding the filters bar does NOT prevent users from changing filters by other means. For information on how to set up secure data access control policies, see the Access control and permission management documentation page.
```
embed_style:
  show_filters_bar: true

```

### `tile_background_color`
Sets the color of the background of all tiles on an embedded dashboard.
```
embed_style:
  tile_background_color: "lightyellow"

```

### `tile_text_color`
Sets the color of text on all tiles on an embedded dashboard.
```
embed_style:
  tile_text_color: "crimson"

```

## `elements`
> This section refers to the `elements` parameter that is part of a `dashboard`.
> `elements` can also be used as part of a dashboard row, described on the `elements` for rows section on this page.
The `elements` parameter starts the section of LookML where you define the elements that will make up a dashboard. There are many parameters that can define the appearance of a dashboard element. They are described in more detail on the Dashboard element parameters page.
```
- dashboard: sales_overview
  layout: tile
  elements:
  - name: order_count
    type: single_value
    model: ecommerce
    explore: orders
    measures: [orders.count]

```

> Think about the number and complexity of elements that you add to a LookML dashboard. More elements require more browser resources, which increases dashboard rendering time. Similarly, elements that render large amounts of data may impact dashboard performance. If rendering becomes an issue, consider reducing the complexity of dashboard element queries or creating multiple dashboards with fewer elements.
