#  Release deployment emails
Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 
Release notifications are emailed to customers in advance of new releases. Emails are distributed to users who have opted in as described on this documentation page.
## Looker-hosted instances
All email addresses listed in the **Admin** panel as Technical Contacts will receive notifications regarding the expected update window prior to deployment of a new Looker release. These deployment notices are considered operational and cannot be managed in the Preference Center. If it's necessary to change the recipients for these notices, please edit the email addresses in **Admin settings**. To safeguard against missing or outdated technical contact information, we may also reach out to contacts listed in our CRM.
All users who opt in to release emails may also receive feature-specific notices. Users subscribed to **Product feature updates** in the Preference Center will receive release emails. Regardless of the release their instance is on, a user can update their subscription from their User Account Settings page. _Note: Prior to Looker 5.14, opt-in was offered via Looker account creation._
## Customer-hosted instances
All emails listed in the **Admin > General Settings** as Technical Contacts and our CRM's technical contacts will receive notifications.
