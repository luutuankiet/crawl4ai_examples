You can share your data in several ways, depending on your delivery preferences and whether you're sharing with other Looker users or with recipients outside your Looker instance.
## Sharing your data
To share data from Looker, you can:
  * Create a query and immediately send the results to yourself or other people. You do not need to save the query as a Look or dashboard first.
  * Deliver a Look or deliver a dashboard immediately or on a recurring schedule in an email or to another destination. For an overview of Looker's content delivery capabilities, see the Using the Looker Scheduler to deliver content documentation page.
  * Grab any one of a series of URLs with which other Looker users can open a query or Look.
  * Download a Look or an Explore and then send the downloaded content.
  * Publish a Look with a public URL to an audience that includes people who don't use Looker, by enabling public access and sharing the Look's URL, embedding its visualization or data table into a web page and sharing the webpage's URL, or importing the Look into a Google Sheet or an MS Excel spreadsheet.
  * Deliver content to third-party services integrated with Looker using an action hub server.
  * Create an alert to receive a notification when the results of a dashboard tile reach or exceed a specified threshold.
