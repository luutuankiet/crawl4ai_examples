> This page is about delivering content from Looks and Explores. For information about scheduling dashboards, visit the Scheduling and sending dashboards documentation page.
Looker provides several ways to share content from dashboards, data tables or visualizations from a Look, or Explore queries to the applications and services that are already a part of your workflow. With Looker's scheduling capability, you can send instant, one-time content deliveries or periodic, recurring content deliveries — also called "schedules" — to one of Looker's built-in delivery destinations or to a third-party service that is integrated with Looker. Built-in delivery destinations include email, webhook, an Amazon S3 bucket, and an SFTP server.
Looker admins and developers play critical roles in configuring schedules so that all Looker users can deliver content. See the following links for documentation that is relevant to each of these roles and to all Looker users.
